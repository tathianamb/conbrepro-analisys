Therefore, the publication trends (PT) and bibliometric analysis (BA) on MLARE research published and indexed in the Elsevier Scopus database between 2012 and 2021 were examined. The PT was adopted to deduce the major stakeholders, top-cited publications, and funding organizations on MLARE, whereas BA elucidated critical insights into the research landscape, scientific developments, and technological growth. The PT revealed 1218 published documents comprising 46.9% articles, 39.7% conference papers, and 6.0% reviews on the topic. Subject area analysis revealed MLARE research spans the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics among others, which indicates it is a broad, multidisciplinary, and impactful research topic. The most prolific researcher, affiliations, country, and funder are Ravinesh C. Deo, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, United States, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, respectively. The most prominent journals on the top are Applied Energy and Energies, which indicates that journal reputation and open access are critical considerations for the author's choice of publication outlet. The high productivity of the major stakeholders in MLARE is due to collaborations and research funding support. The keyword co-occurrence analysis identified four (4) clusters or thematic areas on MLARE, which broadly describe the systems, technologies, tools/technologies, and socio-technical dynamics of MLARE research. Overall, the study showed that ML is critical to the prediction, operation, and optimization of renewable energy technologies (RET) along with the design and development of RE-related materials.","[Ajibade, Samuel-Soma M.] Istanbul Ticaret Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-34445 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Bekun, Festus Victor] Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Fac Econ Adm & Social Sci, TR-34310 Istanbul, Turkiye; [Bekun, Festus Victor] Lebanese Amer Univ, Adnan Kassar Sch Business, Dept Econ, Beirut 11022801, Lebanon; [Adedoyin, Festus Fatai] Bournemouth Univ, Dept Comp & Informat, Poole BH12 5BB, England; [Gyamfi, Bright Akwasi] Sir Padampat Singhania Univ, Sch Management, Udaipur 313601, India; [Adediran, Anthonia Oluwatosin] Fed Polytech, Dept Estate Management, Ado Ekiti 23401, Nigeria",Istanbul Ticaret University; Istanbul Gelisim University; Lebanese American University; Bournemouth University; Sir Padampat Singhania University,"Bekun, FV (corresponding author), Istanbul Gelisim Univ, Fac Econ Adm & Social Sci, TR-34310 Istanbul, Turkiye.;Bekun, FV (corresponding author), Lebanese Amer Univ, Adnan Kassar Sch Business, Dept Econ, Beirut 11022801, Lebanon.",fbekun@gelisim.edu.tr,"Adedoyin, Festus/AAM-4667-2020; Ajibade, Samuel-Soma/GRF-1213-2022; Bekun, Festus/AAU-3573-2020; Gyamfi, Bright/AAT-3569-2020","Adedoyin, Festus/0000-0002-3586-2570; Bekun, festus victor/0000-0003-4948-6905; Gyamfi, Bright Akwasi/0000-0002-7567-9885; Ajibade, Samuel-Soma Mofoluwa/0000-0002-3452-1889",,,,,77,4,4,1,5,,,,,2571-8797,,,,JUN,2023,5,2,,,,,497,517,,10.3390/cleantechnol5020026,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cleantechnol5020026,,,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:001014157600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The heat transfer capacity of the working fluid has a huge impact on the efficiency of the renewable energy system. The addition of a small amount of high thermal conductivity solid nanoparticles to a base fluid improves heat transfer. Even though a large amount of research data is available in the literature, some results are contradictory. Many influencing factors, as well as nonlinearity and refutations, make nanofluid research highly challenging and obstruct its potentially valuable uses. On the other hand, data-driven machine learning techniques would be very useful in nanofluid research for forecasting thermophysical features and heat transfer rate, identifying the most influential factors, and assessing the efficiencies of different renewable energy systems. The primary aim of this review study is to look at the features and applications of different machine learning techniques employed in the nanofluid-based renewable energy system, as well as to reveal new developments in machine learning research. A variety of modern machine learning algorithms for nanofluid-based heat transfer studies in renewable and sustainable energy systems are examined, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Artificial neural networks-based model prediction using contemporary commercial software is simple to develop and the most popular. The prognostic capacity may be further improved by combining a marine predator algorithm, genetic algorithm, swarm intelligence optimization, and other intelligent optimization approaches. In addition to the well-known neural networks and fuzzy- and gene-based machine learning techniques, newer ensemble machine learning techniques such as Boosted regression techniques, K-means, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), CatBoost, and XGBoost are gaining popularity due to their improved architectures and adaptabilities to diverse data types. The regularly used neural networks and fuzzy-based algorithms are mostly black-box methods, with the user having little or no understanding of how they function. This is the reason for concern, and ethical artificial intelligence is required.","[Sharma, Prabhakar; Kumar, Anurag] Delhi Skill & Entrepreneurship Univ, Sch Engn Sci, Delhi 110089, India; [Nizetic, Sandro] Univ Split, FESB, Split 21000, Croatia; [Pandey, Ashok] CSIR Indian Inst Toxicol Res, Ctr Innovat & Translat Res, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Pandey, Ashok] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Sustainabil Cluster, Sch Engn, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttarakhand, India; [Pandey, Ashok] Ctr Energy & Environm Sustainabil, Lucknow 226029, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Huang, Zuohua] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Multiphase Flow Power Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Afzal, Asif] PA Coll Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Mangaluru 574153, India; [Afzal, Asif] Visvesvaraya Technol Univ, Belgavi, India; [Li, Changhe] Qingdao Univ Technol, Sch Mech & Automot Engn, Qingdao 266520, Peoples R China; [Anh Tuan Le] Hanoi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Hanoi 10999, Vietnam; [Xuan Phuong Nguyen; Viet Dung Tran] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Transport, PATET Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City 717000, Vietnam; [Anh Tuan Hoang] HUTECH Univ, Inst Engn, Ho Chi Minh City 717000, Vietnam; [Said, Zafar] Univ Sharjah, Dept Sustainable & Renewable Energy Engn, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Said, Zafar] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, US Pakistan Ctr Adv Studies Energy USPCAS E, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",University of Split; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR); University of Petroleum & Energy Studies (UPES); Xi'an Jiaotong University; Visvesvaraya Technological University; Qingdao University of Technology; Hanoi University of Science & Technology (HUST); Ho Chi Minh City University of Transport; University of Sharjah; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Sharma, P (corresponding author), Delhi Skill & Entrepreneurship Univ, Sch Engn Sci, Delhi 110089, India.;Nguyen, XP (corresponding author), Ho Chi Minh City Univ Transport, PATET Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City 717000, Vietnam.;Hoang, AT (corresponding author), HUTECH Univ, Inst Engn, Ho Chi Minh City 717000, Vietnam.;Said, Z (corresponding author), Univ Sharjah, Dept Sustainable & Renewable Energy Engn, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates.;Said, Z (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, US Pakistan Ctr Adv Studies Energy USPCAS E, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",psharmahal@gmail.com; zsaid@sharjah.ac.ae; hatuan@hutech.edu.vn; phuong@ut.edu.vn,"Li, Changhe/D-6462-2012; Pandey, Ashok/AAC-6340-2019; Tran Viet, Dung/AGT-2066-2022; Nižetić, Sandro/G-4810-2017; Le, Tuan/J-9881-2019; SHARMA, PRABHAKAR/ISU-9669-2023; Nguyen Xuan, Phuong/AAT-9669-2021; Huang, zuohua/G-6403-2011; Hoang, Anh Tuan/C-4780-2019; said, Zafar/C-4086-2016; Afzal, Asif/U-3071-2017","SHARMA, PRABHAKAR/0000-0002-7585-6693; Hoang, Anh Tuan/0000-0002-3433-7029; Nguyen Xuan, Phuong/0000-0003-0354-8648; Huang, zuohua/0000-0002-8932-5842; Hoang, Anh Tuan/0000-0002-1767-8040; said, Zafar/0000-0003-2376-9309; Le, Anh Tuan/0000-0003-4609-0382; Pandey, Ashok/0000-0003-1626-3529; Afzal, Asif/0000-0003-2961-6186",,,,,336,171,172,33,183,,,,0887-0624,1520-5029,,,,JUL 7,2022,36,13,,,,,6626,6658,,10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c01006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c01006,,JUN 2022,,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:000821894600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Positive Energy Building (PEB) model has been developed by the European Union as part of Horizon 2020 to contribute to a cleaner neighborhood environment. To achieve PEB goals, a variety of factors must be optimized, including occupant comfort, building efficiency, economic benefits, and clean energy provision. Building modeling simulation combined with data-driven tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to predict energy production and optimize passive and active systems. Based on these findings, this study evaluates studies from the past decade that include data-driven approaches, which accelerate different aspects of PEB, including supply and demand. These aspects include renewable energy supply prediction with the local context, optimizing comfort control with IoT, and reducing demand by optimizing building envelope design, materials selection, and active systems. While there are a few surveys regarding renewable energy management and energy efficiency in buildings, none simultaneously classified the algorithms in a PEB framework. Hence, this work inherently creates a technical framework for future researchers and building engineers to apply the appropriate data-driven approach for achieving net positive energy performance in residential, educational, and commercial buildings. Finally, comparing different applications suggests future research problems that can be addressed by integrating optimization algorithms and machine learning approaches, as well as data gaps that can be resolved to improve prediction accuracy.","[Mousavi, SeyedehNiloufar; Villarreal-Marroquin, Maria Guadalupe; Smith, Neale R.] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Ave Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico; [Hajiaghaei-Keshteli, Mostafa] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Puebla, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Villarreal-Marroquín, MG (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Ave Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico.",,"Smith, Neale/GNH-1731-2022; mousavi, SeyedehNiloufar/HNJ-6402-2023; Hajiaghaei-Keshteli, Mostafa/Y-4046-2019","mousavi, Seyedehniloufar/0000-0002-6886-2286; Hajiaghaei-Keshteli, Mostafa/0000-0002-9988-2626",,,,,182,18,18,18,78,,,,0360-1323,1873-684X,,,,AUG 15,2023,242,,,,,,,,110578,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110578,,JUL 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:001036832400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Building load prediction is one of the most critical components for many building control and analytics activities, as well as grid-interactive and energy efficiency building operation. While a large number of research papers exist on the topic of machine-learning-based building load prediction, a comprehensive review from the perspective of machine learning is missing. In this paper, we review the application of machine learning techniques in building load prediction under the organization and logic of the machine learning, which is to perform tasks T using Performance measure P and based on learning from Experience E. Firstly, we review the applications of building load prediction model (task T). Then, we review the modeling algorithms that improve machine learning performance and accuracy (performance P). Throughout the papers, we also review the literature from the data perspective for modeling (experience E), including data engineering from the sensor level to data level, pre-processing, feature extraction and selection.

Therefore, the utilization of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in power systems is seeing rapid growth on a global level, particularly in offshore locations. This work aims to review the progress in developing hybrid RES power systems in offshore environments and optimization methods used for power generation using solar, wind, and wave energy systems. The papers published in peer-reviewed journals were collected from 2000 to 2023. A total of 143 articles were obtained and analyzed. The results demonstrated a rising trend in annual publications about the use of hybrid RES in electricity generation since 2007. The hybrid solar-wind and wind-wave energy systems have received a lot of attention due to technical advancements already developed for the wind energy system. Machine learning techniques, such as genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), have been extensively utilized in the field of renewable energy systems for tasks such as optimizing unit sizes, determining appropriate unit placements, minimizing costs, and maximizing power output. The methods are preferred due to their less complex structure. However, the practical application, true cost estimation and installation and maintenance studies at offshore locations are poorly developed. Also, the hybrid solar-wave and solar-wind-wave RES systems need further investigations for optimal mixing at the feasibility stage. The current review is the first of its kind, focusing on offshore renewable energy systems only.","[Khurshid, Hifsa; Mohammed, Bashar S.; Al-Yacouby, Ahmad Mahamad; Liew, M.

However, scientific advancements are still needed to determine the optimal technological paths for economical and eco-friendly hydrogen production. The paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the evolving landscape of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction through electrochemical methods, with a specific focus on the optimization achieved through machine learning techniques. A corpus of 306 documents, comprising 276 articles and 33 reviews, spanning the years 2009 to 2023, was systematically extracted from the Web of Science database. Employing sophisticated bibliometric tools such as VOSviewer, Bibliometric, HistCite, and Giphe, an in-depth examination of the scholarly output was conducted in this domain. The analysis not only identifies key contributors shaping the field but also investigates the interdisciplinary connections that have played crucial roles in advancing the optimization of electrochemical hydrogen production. The review highlights the emergence of novel approaches, such as density functional theory coupled with neural networks for catalyst discovery, and support vector machine learning for optimizing small to medium size data set. In addition, a range of artificial intelligence techniques such as multilayer perceptron-artificial neural networking, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, genetic algorithms -adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and gaussian process lead to the highest correlation and the lowest error for prediction of the hydrogen production.

However, the performance of the power generated is highly sensitive on climate and seasonal factors. The unpredictable behaviour of the climate affects the power output and causes an unfavourable impact on the stability, reliability and operation of the grid. Thus an accurate forecasting of PV output is a crucial requirement to ensure the stability and reliability of the grid.

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is an attractive option to solve the issue of poor interoperability in black-box methods. This review investigates the relationship between renewable energy (RE) and XAI. It emphasizes the potential advantages of XAI in improving the performance and efficacy of RE systems. It is realized that although the integration of XAI with RE has enormous potential to alter how energy is produced and consumed, possible hazards and barriers remain to be overcome, particularly concerning transparency, accountability, and fairness.

Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of processes for biodiesel production and use, fast and accurate modeling tools are required for their design, optimization, monitoring, and control. Data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated superior predictive capability compared to conventional methods for modeling such highly complex processes. Among the available ML techniques, the artificial neural network (ANN) technology is the most widely used approach in biodiesel research. The ANN approach is a computational learning method that mimics the human brain's neurological processing ability to map input-output relationships of ill-defined systems. Given its high generalization capacity, ANN has gained popularity in dealing with complex nonlinear real-world engineering and scientific problems. This paper is devoted to thoroughly reviewing and critically discussing various ML technology applications, with a particular focus on ANN, to solve function approximation, optimization, monitoring, and control problems in biodiesel research. Moreover, the advantages and disadvantages of using ML technology in biodiesel research are highlighted to direct future R&D efforts in this domain. ML technology has generally been used in biodiesel research for modeling (trans)esterification processes, physico-chemical characteristics of biodiesel, and biodiesel-fueled internal combustion engines. The primary purpose of introducing ML technology to the biodiesel industry has been to monitor and control biodiesel systems in real-time; however, these issues have rarely been explored in the literature. Therefore, future studies appear to be directed towards the use of ML techniques for real-time process monitoring and control of biodiesel systems to enhance production efficiency, economic viability, and environmental sustainability.

The cold climate and the albedo effect of snow in these regions present favorable operating conditions for PV cells and an opportunity to realize the seasonal matching of generation and consumption respectively. However, the erratic nature of PV brings a threat to the operation of the grid. PV power forecasting has been used as an economical solution to minimize and even overcome this limitation. This paper is therefore a comprehensive review of machine learning-based PV output power forecasting models in the literature in the context of Nordic climate. The impact of meteorological parameters and the soiling effect due to snow, which is unique to this climate, on the performance of a prediction model is discussed. PV power forecasting models in the literature are systematically classified into multiple groups and each group is analyzed and important suggestions are made for choosing a better model for these regions. Ensemble methods, optimization algorithms, time-series decomposition, and weather clustering are identified as important techniques that can be used to enhance performance. And notably, this work proposed two conceptual approaches that can be used to incorporate the effect of snow on PV power forecasting. Future research needs to focus on this area, which is crucial for the development of PV in these regions.","[Dimd, Berhane Darsene; Voller, Steve; Cali, Umit; Midtgard, Ole-Morten] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Power Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Dimd, BD (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Power Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",berhane.d.dimd@ntnu.no,"Dimd, Berhane/JFA-8847-2023","Midtgard, Ole-Morten/0000-0001-6366-4515; Voller, Steve/0000-0002-9949-3970; Dimd, Berhane Darsene/0000-0002-3524-4940; Cali, Umit/0000-0002-6402-0479",,,,,96,21,21,8,74,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2022,10,,,,,,26404,26425,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3156942,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3156942,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:000769961600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have emerged as short-to-mid-term solutions to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The absorption-based post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) technology is considered the most established, traditional, and operational approach compared to other CCS technologies. Modelling and optimizing the PCC process, such as operating conditions, equipment configurations, and solvent management, are time-consuming and computationally expensive. Machine Learning (ML) has gained significant attraction as a powerful tool for conducting complex computations that facilitate the training of computer algorithms to perform specific tasks with exceptional precision, which is unattainable through conventional tools. They have been used for various applications in an efficient and costeffective approach, including classification, prediction, clustering, ranking, and data optimization. In this article, we review the recent research progress on applying ML methods to PCC absorption-based technologies. This review provides a practical guide to categorizing the various ML methods used in PCC technologies based on limits, availability, and pros and cons.

This paper presents a review of the system architecture of DESs for building decarbonization, including hybrid energy systems, en-ergy storage technologies, building flexible loads, and electric vehicles. The uncertainties from both the environment and human interventions challenge the energy management due to the asynchrony between energy generation and energy consumption. Thus, the system should be optimally designed and operated to enhance the reliability, affordability, and flexibility of the DES. The paper highlights the adoption of optimization approaches.

Biofuel can be used instead of fossil fuel due to environmental benefits and availability to produce various energy sorts like electricity, power, and heating or to sustain transportation fuels. Biodiesel production is an intricate process that requires identifying unknown nonlinear relationships between the system input and output data; therefore, accurate and swift modeling instruments like machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI) are necessary to design, handle, control, optimize, and monitor the system. Among the biodiesel production modeling methods, machine learning provides better predictions with the highest accuracy, inspired by the brain's autolearning and self-improving capability to solve the study's complicated questions; therefore, it is beneficial for modeling (trans) esterification processes, physicochemical properties, and monitoring biodiesel systems in real-time.

A reliable solar radiation prediction is essential for various applications in agriculture, industry, transport, and the environment because they reduce greenhouse gases and are environmentally friendly. Solar radiation data series have embedded fluctuations and noise signals due to complexity, stochasticity, non-stationarity, and nonlinearity with uncertain and time-varying nature. Aside from being highly nonlinear, solar radiation is highly influenced by the environment and environmental parameters such as air temperature, cloud cover, surface reflectivity, and aerosols. In addition, the spatial measurements of these variables are not readily available. To tackle these challenges, it is necessary to consider data preprocessing techniques and to develop and test precise solar radiation predicting models at different forecast horizons. There is, however, controversy regarding the performance of such models in various studies. Comparisons are not conducted systematically among the different studies. Using a critical literature review, the authors hope to answer these questions and believe that further investigation of solar radiation can benefit researchers and practitioners alike. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of solar radiation modeling using artificial intelligence in the last 15 years and provides a novel detailed analysis of the available models. The studies conducted in different climates of the world that were published in distinguished journals were considered (i.e., 90 papers in total) for this purpose. Newly discovered procedures for optimizing forecasts, data cleaning, feature selection, classification methods, and stand-alone or hybrid data-driven models for solar radiation prediction and modeling were evaluated. The results strikingly showed that the most used artificial intelligence methods were artificial neural network, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and decision tree family of models. In addition, the extreme learning machine, support vector machine, and particle swarm optimization were the most used optimization techniques in solar radiation modeling. In terms of forecast horizons, the most common forecast horizon found in papers was on the daily scale (51% of studies), followed by the hourly scale (26%), and the least common was the monthly scale (18%). Based on the regional studies, the highest number of solar radiation papers originated from Asia, with Europe in second place and African countries in third place. An increasing trend in the number of papers from 2011 to 2015 was noted, and the second peak started from 2018 till the present. Under each section, a summary of findings is provided. The paper concludes with future thoughts and directions on solar radiation modeling.","[Attar, Nasrin Fathollahzadeh; Sattari, Mohammad Taghi] Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Sattari, Mohammad Taghi; Apaydin, Halit] Ankara Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Engn, TR-06110 Ankara, Turkey; [Prasad, Ramendra] Univ Fiji, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Sci, Lautoka, Fiji",University of Tabriz; Ankara University,"Sattari, MT (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz, Iran.;Sattari, MT (corresponding author), Ankara Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr Engn, TR-06110 Ankara, Turkey.",NasrinFathollahzadehAttar@tabrizu.ac.ir; mtsattar@tabrizu.ac.ir; ramendrap23@gmail.com; apaydin@ankara.edu.tr,"Prasad, Ramendra/AAT-2908-2021; Sattari, Mohammad Taghi/AAI-3212-2020; APAYDIN, Halit/A-3134-2016; Fathollahzadeh Attar, Nasrin/P-6175-2017","Prasad, Ramendra/0000-0003-3941-5839; Sattari, Mohammad Taghi/0000-0002-5139-2118; APAYDIN, Halit/0000-0002-9875-7321; Fathollahzadeh Attar, Nasrin/0000-0002-9506-452X",,,,,84,5,5,9,24,,,,1618-954X,1618-9558,,,,MAY,2023,25,4,,,,,1079,1097,,10.1007/s10098-022-02434-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10098-022-02434-7,,DEC 2022,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:000894378800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is no systematic and in-depth analysis on this topic in the academia. In this study, a state-of-the-art review on novel PCMs based strategies to reduce cooling load of buildings has been presented. The investigated strategies include the structural configuration, systematic control and the multi-criteria for assessment. The roles of ventilations, radiative cooling and the underlying heat transfer mechanism have been characterized for the in-depth understanding. In order to realise the multivariable optimal design and robust operations under multi-level scenario uncertainties, parametric and uncertainty analysis, single- and multi-objective optimisations have been comprehensively reviewed, together with technical challenges for each solution. Research results show that, integrated passive and active systems with flexible transitions on operating modes are full of prospects for the multi-criteria performance improvement. Trade-off solutions along the multi-objective Pareto frontier are multi-diversified, dependent on the adopted approach and the studied scenario. Furthermore, machine learning methods are promising for the thermal and energy performances improvement, through the surrogate model development, the model predictive control and the optimisation function. Future studies and prospects have been demonstrated as avenues for future research. This study presents a systematic overview on novel PCMs based strategies, together with the application of machine-learning methods for cooling performance enhancement, which are critical for the promotion of novel PCMs based cooling strategies in buildings.","[Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Siqian] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqiang] Hunan Univ, Natl Ctr Int Res Collaborat Bldg Safety & Environ, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqiang] Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; City University of Hong Kong; Hunan University; Hunan University,"Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Fac Construct & Environm, Dept Bldg Serv Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zheng, SQ (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yuekuan.zhou@connect.polyu.hk; candyz129@sina.com,"Zhou, Yuekuan/ABE-4194-2020",,,,,,102,52,53,8,126,,,,0360-1323,1873-684X,,,,MAY,2020,174,,,,,,,,106786,10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106786,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106786,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Construction & Building Technology; Engineering,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:000521983200018,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, traditional study methodologies were deemed inadequate, prompting the need for computational methods to offer numerical solutions. This approach was seen as a creative and practical solution to the problem at hand. In response to the limitations of conventional modeling approaches, researchers turned towards the innovative solution of using machine-learning techniques as data processing systems. This creative approach has proven effective in addressing a broad variety of technical and scientific concerns, particularly in fields where traditional modeling approaches have fallen short of expectations. This review discusses using machine learning algorithms for predicting biodiesel performance and emissions with nanoparticles. Researchers have solved these problems with the application of machine learning to anticipate engine efficiency and emissions. The machine-learning algorithm predicts engine performance very precisely, proving its efficacy. Nanotechnology and biodiesel engine technologies are quickly advancing, making this review vital. Previous studies have examined nanoparticles' influence on engine performance and emissions. This review uniquely focuses on the application of machine learning techniques. Through the utilization of machine-learning algorithms, it is possible for gaining deeper understanding of intricate connections existing between the properties of nanoparticles and the behavior of engines. This methodology provides extensive comprehension of an impact of nanoparticles upon performance and emissions of biodiesel engines, hence enabling a development of more effectual and sustainable engine designs.","[Pawar, Chetan; Shreeprakash, B.; Mokshanatha, Beekanahalli] Srinivas Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Coll Engn Technol, Mangaluru 574146, India; [Pawar, Chetan; Nikam, Keval Chandrakant; Motgi, Nitin] Dr DY Patil Inst Engn Management & Res, Dept Mech Engn, Pune 411044, India; [Jathar, Laxmikant D.] Army Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Pune 411015, India; [Shelare, Sagar D.] Priyadarshini Coll Engn, Dept Mech Engn, Nagpur 440019, Maharashtra, India; [Shelare, Sagar D.; Sharma, Shubham] Chitkara Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Ctr Res Impact & Outcome, Rajpura 140401, Punjab, India; [Sharma, Shubham] Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Beirut 11022801, Lebanon; [Dwivedi, Shashi Prakash] Lloyd Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Knowledge Pk 2, Greater Noida 201306, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Bains, Pardeep Singh] Jain Univ, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Bengaluru 560069, Karnataka, India; [Bains, Pardeep Singh] Vivekananda Global Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Jaipur 303012, Rajasthan, India; [Kumar, Abhinav] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Nucl & Renewable Energy, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia; [Abbas, Mohamed] King Khalid Univ, Coll Engn, Elect Engn Dept, Abha 61421, Saudi Arabia","Chitkara University, Punjab; Lebanese American University; Jain University; Vivekananda Global University; Ural Federal University; King Khalid University","Sharma, S (corresponding author), Chitkara Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Ctr Res Impact & Outcome, Rajpura 140401, Punjab, India.;Sharma, S (corresponding author), Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Beirut 11022801, Lebanon.",shubham543sharma@gmail.com,"Motgi, Nitin/AAD-1872-2022; Dwivedi, Shashi/D-3685-2016; Jathar, Laxmikant/GNH-5957-2022; Shelare, Sagar/AAY-9547-2021","Shelare, Sagar/0000-0002-3368-3587",,,,,123,1,1,0,0,,,,1134-3060,1886-1784,,,,2024 JUN 13,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11831-024-10144-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11831-024-10144-0,,JUN 2024,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Mathematics,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:001245990100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are five general approaches by which system operators and market participants can use probabilistic forecasts of wind, solar, and load to help manage this uncertainty. These include operator situation awareness, resource risk hedging, reserves procurement, definition of contingencies, and explicit stochastic optimization. We review these approaches, and then provide a case study in which a method for using probabilistic solar forecasts to define needs for reserves is developed and evaluated. The case study has three parts. First, we describe building blocks for enhancing the Watt-Sun solar forecasting system to produce probabilistic irradiance and power forecasts. Second, relationships between Watt-Sun forecasts for multiple sites in California and the system's need for flexible ramp capability (flexiramp) are defined by machine learning and statistical methods. Third, the performance of present methods to defining flexiramp requirements, which are not conditioned on weather and renewables forecasts, is compared with that of probabilistic solar forecast-based requirements, using a multi-timescale production costing model with an 1820-bus representation of the WECC power system.

In Saudi Arabia, steam power plants that relay on boilers to produce the steam accounted for around 50% of the total electricity generation capacity in 2021, in addition to 15% capacity from co-generation power plants. Fossil-based energy production produces harmful emissions, mostly NOx. The case of combustion efficiency and NOx emissions is complicated and cannot be addressed by simple theoretical model. This paper investigates the existing literature exploring data driven approaches via Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in a variety of applications, including mainly boiler optimization for efficient and clean energy production. The study discusses the importance of energy intelligence for industries in supporting decision making and prediction considering supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Expert systems, artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), and different hybrid systems, which incorporate two or more techniques, are all included in AI systems. A condensed review of some recent literature is presented on the applications of support vector machines, ANN, GA, FL, and hybrid systems to combustion systems for emphasizing boilers' performance and emissions. An overview of boiler dynamics and control are presented and the use of AI for trade-off between boiler's efficiency and NOx emissions is discussed, with special focus being made on hydrogen combustion. The reported findings in this study demonstrate the promise of AI in control of emissions and optimization of performance in boilers with the least amount of construction and operating expenditures. The complexity and a number of restrictions present in emissions control systems, however, may reduce the likelihood of success. The specific perspectives are found to be data availability, data reliability, validity of methodology, and system complexity. It is concluded that wide variety of AI approaches have been used in a diversity of disciplines for modelling, predicting performance and controlling emissions of combustion processes. It is indicated that data representing the history and performance of real systems along with the proper selection of the AI model are crucial for setting up such systems. Based on this study, it can be stated that AI models are great tools towards better performance of boilers at minimum emissions.","[Nemitallah, Medhat A.; Alzahrani, Fahad; Habib, Mohamed A.; Aliyu, Mansur] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Hydrogen & Energy Storag, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Nemitallah, Medhat A.] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Aerosp Engn Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Nemitallah, Medhat A.; Nabhan, Mohammad A.; Alowaifeer, Maad; Haeruman, Agus; Alzahrani, Fahad; Habib, Mohamed A.; Elshafei, Moustafa; Abouheaf, Mohammed I.; Aliyu, Mansur; Alfarraj, Motaz] Joint Res Ctr Artificial Intelligence JRC AI, SDAIA KFUPM, KFUPM, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia; [Nemitallah, Medhat A.] CARE Energy Res & Innovat Ctr Dhahran, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Nabhan, Mohammad A.] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Alowaifeer, Maad; Alfarraj, Motaz] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Elect Engn Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Haeruman, Agus; Alzahrani, Fahad; Habib, Mohamed A.] King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Mech Engn Dept, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; [Elshafei, Moustafa] Commun & Informat Program, Zewail City Sci & Technol & Innovat, October Gardens, Giza Governorate 12578, Egypt; [Abouheaf, Mohammed I.] Bowling Green State Univ, Mechatron Engn Technol, Bowling Green, OH 43403 USA",King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals; University System of Ohio; Bowling Green State University,"Nemitallah, MA (corresponding author), King Fahd Univ Petr & Minerals, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr Hydrogen & Energy Storag, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.",medhatahmed@kfupm.edu.sa,"Alfarraj, Motaz/IZD-5232-2023; Aliyu, Mansur/GVT-9424-2022; Elshafei, Moustafa/AAD-9128-2020; Abouheaf, Mohammed/D-7416-2015; Alzahrani, Fahad/ABA-2341-2020; Nemitallah, Medhat/D-5815-2015; Habib, Mohamed A./E-3112-2015","Nemitallah, Medhat/0000-0001-9075-2844; Alowaifeer, Maad/0000-0003-0555-8620; Haeruman, Agus/0009-0001-4640-2481; Habib, Mohamed A./0000-0003-3459-1462; Alzahrani, Fahad/0000-0001-5101-7118; Abouheaf, Mohammed/0000-0002-6130-9015",,,,,172,13,13,40,90,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,SEP 10,2023,417,,,,,,,,138109,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138109,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138109,,JUL 2023,,"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:001050201300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forecasting solar radiation supports different applications focused on the generation and transport of energy in places where there are no meteorological stations. Different solar radiation prediction techniques have been applied in different time horizons, such as neural networks (ANN) or machine learning (ML), with the latter being the most important. The support vector machine (SVM) is a classification method of the ML that is used to predict solar radiation. To obtain a better accuracy of prediction data, search optimization algorithms (SOA) such as genetic algorithms (GA) and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) were used to optimize the prediction accuracy by searching the model parameters. This article presents a review of different hybrid SVM models with SOA applied to obtain the best parameters to reduce the prediction error of solar radiation using meteorological variables. Research articles from the last 5 years on solar radiation prediction using SVM models and hybrid SMV optimized models with SOA were studied. The results show that SVM with GA presents a better performance than the classical SVM models using the Radial basis kernel function for prediction parameters.","[Manuel Alvarez-Alvarado, Jose] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, Div Invest & Posgrad, Queretaro 76010, Mexico; [Gabriel Rios-Moreno, Jose; Antonio Obregon-Biosca, Saul; Ventura-Ramos, Eusebio, Jr.; Trejo-Perea, Mario] Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, Queretaro 76010, Mexico; [Ronquillo-Lomeli, Guillermo] Ctr Ingn & Desarrollo Ind, Queretaro 76125, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro; Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro; CIDESI - Centro de Ingenieria y Desarrollo Industrial,"Ríos-Moreno, JG (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Queretaro, Fac Ingn, Queretaro 76010, Mexico.",jmalvarez@uaq.mx; riosg@uaq.mx; saul.obregon@uaq.mx; gronquillo@cidesi.edu.max; eventura@uaq.mx; mtp@uaq.mx,"Álvarez, José/AFC-4921-2022; Ríos-Moreno, José/ABG-2956-2021; Obregón-Biosca, Saúl/AAX-5843-2020; Ronquillo-Lomeli, Guillermo/K-6882-2019","Obregon-Biosca, Saul/0000-0001-6915-4671; Ronquillo-Lomeli, Guillermo/0000-0003-2459-1602; Trejo, Mario/0000-0002-7014-3379; Rios-Moreno, Jose Gabriel/0000-0002-8988-2729; Alvarez Alvarado, Jose Manuel/0000-0002-1304-6791",,,,,90,33,36,7,46,,,,,2076-3417,,,,FEB,2021,11,3,,,,,,,1044,10.3390/app11031044,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11031044,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Engineering; Materials Science; Physics,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:000614956100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Research on improving the energy efficiency of production based on artificial intelligence (AI) analysis brings promising solutions, and the digital transformation of industry towards green energy is slowly becoming a reality. New production planning rules, the optimization of the use of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs), and the effective use of production data and their optimization with AI bring further opportunities for sustainable, energy-efficient production. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate and quantify the research results, trends, and research impact on energy management in production based on AI-based demand forecasting. The value of the research includes the broader use of AI which will reduce the impact of the observed environmental and economic problems in the areas of reducing energy consumption, forecasting accuracy, and production efficiency. In addition, the demand for Green AI technologies in creating sustainable solutions, reducing the impact of AI on the environment, and improving the accuracy of forecasts, including in the area of optimization of electricity storage, will increase. A key emerging research trend in green energy management in manufacturing is the use of AI-based demand forecasting to optimize energy consumption, reduce waste, and increase sustainability. An innovative perspective that leverages AI's ability to accurately forecast energy demand allows manufacturers to align energy consumption with production schedules, minimizing excess energy consumption and emissions. Advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms can integrate real-time data from various sources, such as weather patterns and market demand, to improve forecast accuracy. This supports both sustainability and economic efficiency. In addition, AI-based demand forecasting can enable more dynamic and responsive energy management systems, paving the way for smarter, more resilient manufacturing processes.

Renewable energy resources are one possibility to mitigate the dependence of residential buildings on the electrical grid. However, their integration into the existing grid infrastructure must be done carefully to avoid instability, and guarantee availability and security of supply. Demand response, or demand-side management, improves grid stability by increasing demand flexibility, and shifts peak demand towards periods of peak renewable energy generation by providing consumers with economic incentives. This paper reviews the use of reinforcement learning, a machine learning algorithm, for demand response applications in the smart grid. Reinforcement learning has been utilized to control diverse energy systems such as electric vehicles, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, smart appliances, or batteries. The future of demand response greatly depends on its ability to prevent consumer discomfort and integrate human feedback into the control loop. Reinforcement learning is a potentially model-free algorithm that can adapt to its environment, as well as to human preferences by directly integrating user feedback into its control logic. Our review shows that, although many papers consider human comfort and satisfaction, most of them focus on single-agent systems with demand-independent electricity prices and a stationary environment. However, when electricity prices are modelled as demand-dependent variables, there is a risk of shifting the peak demand rather than shaving it. We identify a need to further explore reinforcement learning to coordinate multi-agent systems that can participate in demand response programs under demand-dependent electricity prices. Finally, we discuss directions for future research, e.g., quantifying how RL could adapt to changing urban conditions such as building refurbishment and urban or population growth.","[Vazquez-Canteli, Jose R.; Nagy, Zoltan] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environental Engn, Intelligent Environm Lab, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Nagy, Z (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Civil Architectural & Environental Engn, Intelligent Environm Lab, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",nagy@utexas.edu,"Nagy, Zoltan/E-1435-2016","Nagy, Zoltan/0000-0002-6014-3228; Vazquez-Canteli, Jose Ramon/0000-0001-5437-1892",,,,,166,414,437,63,896,,,,0306-2619,1872-9118,,,,FEB 1,2019,235,,,,,,1072,1089,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.002,,,,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:000458942800087,View Full Record in Web of Science

The application of electric vehicles (EV) in the smart grid has shown a significant option to reduce carbon emission. However, due to the limited battery capacity, managing the charging and discharging process of EV as a distributed power supply is a challenging task. Moreover, the unpredictable nature of renewable energy generation, uncertainties of plug-in electric vehicles associated parameters, energy prices, and the time-varying load create new challenges for the researchers and industries to maintain a stable operation of the power system. The EV battery charging management system plays a main role in coordinating the charging and discharging mechanism to efficiently realize a secure, efficient, and reliable power system. More recently, there has been an increasing interest in data-driven approaches in EV charging modeling. Consequently, researchers are looking to deploy model-free approaches for solving the EV charging management with uncertainties. Among many existing model-free approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used for EV charging management. Unlike other machine learning approaches, the RL technique is based on maximizing the cumulative reward. This article reviews the existing literature related to the RL-based framework, objectives, and architecture for the charging coordination strategies of electric vehicles in the power systems. In addition, the review paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of the techniques used for achieving different charging coordination objectives while satisfying multiple constraints. This article also focuses on the application of RL in EV coordination for research and development of the cutting-edge optimized energy management system (EMS), which are applicable for EV charging.","[Abdullah, Heba M.; Gastli, Adel; Ben-Brahim, Lazhar] Qatar Univ, Coll Engn, Elect Engn Dept, Doha, Qatar",Qatar University,"Abdullah, HM (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Coll Engn, Elect Engn Dept, Doha, Qatar.",ha1808917@qu.edu.qa,,"Gastli, Adel/0000-0002-6818-3320",,,,,118,71,73,21,149,,,,2169-3536,,,,,,2021,9,,,,,,41506,41531,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064354,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3064354,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:000633622800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, hydrogen does not exist in nature as a separate element but only in compound forms. Hydrogen is produced through a process that dissociates it from its compounds. Several methods are used for hydrogen production, which first of all differ in the energy used in this process. Investigating the viability and exact applicability of a method in a specific context requires accurate knowledge of the parameters involved in the method and the interaction between these parameters. This can be done using top-down models relying on complex mathematically driven equations. However, with the raise of computational intelligence (CI) and machine learning techniques, researchers in hydrology have increasingly been using these methods for this complex task and report promising results.

Nevertheless, the proliferation of solar energy poses challenges to power system operations, mostly due to its uncertainty, locational specificity, and variability. The prevalence of smart grids enables artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to mitigate solar integration problems with massive amounts of solar energy data. Different AI subfields (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, ensemble learning, and metaheuristic learning) have brought breakthroughs in solar energy, especially in its grid integration. However, AI research in solar integration is still at the preliminary stage, and is lagging behind the AI mainstream. Aiming to inspire deep AI involvement in the solar energy domain, this paper presents a taxonomical overview of AI applications in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Text mining techniques are first used as an assistive tool to collect, analyze, and categorize a large volume of literature in this field. Then, based on the constructed literature infrastructure, recent advancements in AI applications to solar forecasting, PV array detection, PV system fault detection, design optimization, and maximum power point tracking control problems are comprehensively reviewed. Current challenges and future trends of AI applications in solar integration are also discussed for each application theme.","[Feng, Cong; Liu, Yuanzhi; Zhang, Jie] Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Mech Engn, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Zhang, J (corresponding author), Univ Texas Dallas, Dept Mech Engn, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",jiezhang@utdallas.edu,"Liu, Yuan-Zhi/A-7739-2016; Feng, Cong/J-3292-2019; Zhang, Jie/B-5917-2012","Zhang, Jie/0000-0001-7478-5670",,,,,342,31,31,5,52,,,,0142-0615,1879-3517,,,,NOV,2021,132,,,,,,,,107176,10.1016/j.ijepes.2021.107176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2021.107176,,MAY 2021,,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Engineering,,,,,,2024-09-16,WOS:000694009600017,View Full Record in Web of Science

To provide load-shedding free and uninterrupted power to the consumer, decision-makers in the utility sector must forecast the future demand for electricity with a minimum error percentage. Load prediction with less percentage of error can save millions of dollars to the utility companies. There are numerous Machine Learning (ML) techniques to amicably forecast electricity demand, among which the hybrid models show the best result. Two or more than two predictive models are amalgamated to design a hybrid model, each of which provides improved performances by the merit of individual algorithms. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of electric load forecasting technologies and presents recent works pertaining to the combination of different ML algorithms into two or more methods for the construction of hybrid models. A comprehensive study of each single and multiple load forecasting model is performed with an in-depth analysis of their advantages, disadvantages, and functions.

Hydrogen is the inevitable future of fuel, where its green production remains a challenge. Photoelectrochemical water splitting (PEC-WS) is the most promising green hydrogen production method utilizing the abundance of both Sun energy and water as the main advantages. However, studies scrutinizing PEC-WS from bibliometric analysis and visual perspectives remain scarce. This research endeavors to illuminate the prevailing landscape of PEC-WS via journal visualization analysis and to foster an enriched comprehension of the ongoing trajectory by means of a comprehensive bibliometric evaluation encompassing Scopus bibliometric databases from diverse relevant journals. Our assessment encompassed a corpus of 2903 articles sourced from 72 reputable journals spanning the years from 1981 to August 22, 2023, encapsulating a 42-year period. Over this span, we meticulously scrutinized various parameters including annual advancements, keyword co-occurrence, global participation, funding sponsors, impactful articles, and recent strides in photoanode materials. The findings reveal the growing interest in research in photoanode materials for PEC-WS since 2011. The analysis also identifies key research trends, notably the increasing focus on earth-abundant materials to achieve high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Additionally, this study sheds light on the growing interest in the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) to expedite the development of PEC-WS photoanodes, marking a pivotal advancement in materials discovery and optimization. In the realm of research output, China plays a prominent dual role as both the most contributive country and a leading funding sponsor.

It is possible to extract solar energy from photovoltaic (PV) including rooftop, ground-mounted, and building integrated PV systems. Interest in rooftop PV system applications has increased in recent years due to simple installation and not occupying an external area. However, the negative effects of increased PV penetration on the distribution system are troublesome. The power loss, reverse power flow (RPF), voltage fluctuations, voltage unbalance, are causing voltage quality problems in the power network. On the other hand, variations in system frequency, power factor, and harmonics are affecting the power quality.

Both parameters are highly non-linear and environmental dependent. Hence accurate prediction of these parameters is necessary for the application to various applications in different agriculture, industrial, transport, and environmental sectors because they reduce greenhouse gases and are environmentally friendly. The study indicates that good quality prediction, accurate solar forecasting, and wind speed, using the machine learning methodology, can predict correct data such as temperature, relative moisture, solar radiations, rain, and wind speed. The best way to anticipate extremely nonlinear environmental data, such as wind speed and solar radiation is using the artificial neural system. In this study, the benefits and constraints of various neural artificial network algorithms (RP) are analyzed and compared. These algorithms include the RP, Levenberg Marquardt (LM), Polak-Ribiere update gradient (CGP), and OSS (one step secant) gradient to enhance the accuracy of the wind speed and the predicted solar radiation. All findings suggest that the Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian algorithms for regulation are more resilient and effective to anticipate highly non-linear characteristics, such as solar radiation and wind speed.

A HESS containing battery and ultracapacitor (UC) has drawn much attention. However, there have been relatively few reviews on its structures and energy management strategies (EMSs). Based on the summary and analysis from the existing publications, this paper reviews and discusses the structures and the EMSs of HESSs comprised of battery and UC. Focusing on energy management research, a detailed discussion of rules-based control algorithms, optimization based control algorithms and intelligent-based control algorithms is presented. Several typical implementations and applications are presented in detail, and a comparative evaluation of these methods can help researchers select the appropriate method to develop EMSs for HESSs.

The limitations of renewable energy sources, however, require flexible energy production sources to supplement them. Micro gas turbine based combined heat and power plants, which are used for domestic applications, can fill this gap if they become more reliable. This can be achieved with the use of an engine monitoring and diagnostics system: real-time engine condition monitoring and fault diagnostics results in reduced operating and maintenance costs and increased component and engine life. In order to allow the step change in the connection of small engines to the grid, a fleet monitoring system for micro gas turbines is required. A proposed framework combines a physics-based model and a data-driven model with machine learning capabilities for predicting system behavior, and includes a purpose-developed diagnostic tool for anomaly detection and classification for a multitude of engines. The framework has been implemented on a fleet of micro gas turbines and some of the lessons learned from the demonstration of the concept as well as key takeaways from the general literature are presented in this paper. The extension of fleet monitoring to optimal operation and production planning in relation to the needs of the grid will allow the micro gas turbines to fit in the future green energy system, connect to the grid, and trade in the energy market. The requirements on the system level for the widespread use of micro gas turbines in the energy system are addressed in the paper.

Most energy used for these activities is majorly from conventional sources, which after combustion result in ecological imbalance, climatic affray, health hazards, and degradation of natural resources. Therefore, the quest for eco-friendly energy has made researchers to investigate on alternative energy, such as biogas. This review study presents a comprehensive analysis of various biomass used for biogas production considering the effects that co-digestion of these materials has on biogas yield, as well as the technology involved. It further evaluated the applicability of artificial intelligence for modeling and optimization of the anaerobic digestion process including the blend ratios, process parameters and so on. These indices determine the percentage methane yield from biomaterial. The review effort revealed that methane content of biomaterials digested without pre-treatment varies from 3.6 +/- 0.7 to 443.55 +/- 13.68 N L k g(-1) V S while the yield from biomaterials pre-treated using various methods varies from 301.38 mL CH4/gVS(added) to 0.73-5.87 L/week. Anaerobic digestion of the blends of cow dung, mango pulp, and Chromolaena odorata was reportedly necessary, as information is scantily available on it. The modeling of the resulting experimental data using different machine learning techniques such as an adaptive-neuro-fuzzy inference system and ANFIS for predicting biogas yield is a major information gathered in this study. The AI models reviewed have high correlation factors ranging from 0.8700 to 0.9998.

Since the industries are digitalized, power generation is supported by a variety of resources. Therefore, the forecasting accuracy of different models varies. The power utilities with different generation modalities (DGM) experience complexities and a noticeable amount of error in predicting future electrical consumption. To effectively manage the power flow with negligible power interruptions, a utility must utilize the forecasting tools to predict the future electricity demand with minimum error. Since the current literature supports individual and limited power sources involved in generation for load forecasting, thus the utilities with multiple power sources or DGM remain unexplored. Therefore, exploration of existing literature is required relating to analyzing the existing models which could be considered in load forecasting for DGM. This paper explores state-of-art methods recently utilized for electrical load forecasting highlighting the common practices, recent advances, and exposure of areas available for improvement. The review investigates the methods, parameters, and respective sectors considered for load forecasting. It performs in-depth analysis and discusses the strengths, weaknesses, and error percentages of models. It also highlights the peculiarities of methods used in residential, commercial, industrial, grid, and off-grid sectors aiming to help the researchers to appraise the common practices. Moreover, trends and research gaps are also discussed.","[Azeem, Abdul; Ismail, Idris] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Jameel, Syed Muslim] Natl Univ Ireland Galway NUIG, Sch Engn, Postdoctoral Scientist Struct Lab, Galway H91 TK33, Ireland; [Harindran, V.
