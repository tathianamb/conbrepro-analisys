This paper examines the utilization of advanced meta-heuristics, namely the Siberian Tiger Optimization (STO) and Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithms, for developing HEM systems. The paper presents an integrated STSC algorithm, enhanced by artificial intelligence, that monitors and optimizes household energy usage. To optimize electricity distribution, this algorithm seeks a compromise between reducing costs and lowering the peak-to-average proportion of power. After extensive simulations, the STSC algorithm outperforms previous meta-heuristics in Peak Average Ratio. It demonstrates the possibility of substantial cost reductions in residential settings, reaching up to 8.5%. This improves the overall efficiency of households’ power supply chains. In addition to reducing costs, the STSC algorithm contributes to sustainability objectives by utilizing AI to minimize carbon emissions, including renewable energy sources, and facilitate adaptable demand solutions. This highlights its role in promoting sustainable supply chain practices in energy efficiency. The combined use of STO and SCSO algorithms in the STSC method is a new and innovative development in HEM systems.

In addition, the renewable energy system cannot achieve consistent operation because of the uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and their complex spatiotemporal patterns. Climate change and extreme meteorological phenomena also affect the energy system of the island. Therefore, it is essential to maximize RES exploitation to accomplish carbon-free energy production. This study developed a rolling horizon optimization–based flexible renewable energy distribution planning (FxRE-Plan) based on an artificial intelligence-driven spatiotemporal RES prediction model. An adaptive graph convolutional recurrent network (AGCRN) was used to develop a spatiotemporal prediction model. Then, FxRE-Plan was determined using a multiobjective genetic algorithm to maximize the RES potential under climate change scenarios. The FxRE-Plan was evaluated and compared with the current operation of the electric grid in Jeju Island through economic, environmental cost, and climate change vulnerability assessment index. The results of this research show that the AGCRN–based spatiotemporal prediction model exhibited superior prediction performance, achieving a 95% R2. In addition, the FxRE-Plan reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 11.5% at maximum and climate change vulnerability. Hence, the proposed FxRE-Plan can be used to solve curtailments in real electric grids by pursuing carbon-free islands. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon-free; Climate change vulnerability assessment; Flexible energy planning; Renewable energy sources; Spatiotemporal prediction; Carbon; Climate change; Economics; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Natural resources; Carbon-free; Climate change vulnerability assessment; Distribution planning; Energy distributions; Energy planning; Flexible energy planning; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Spatio-temporal prediction; Vulnerability assessments; alternative energy; climate change; electricity; electricity supply; energy planning; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; vulnerability; Renewable energy resources,Elsevier Ltd,03605442 (ISSN),English,Energy,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: C.

However, weather fluctuations challenge the efficiency of solar systems, making maximum power point tracking (MPPT) systems crucial for optimal energy harvesting. This study compares ten MPPT approaches, including both conventional and artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques. These controllers were designed and implemented using MATLAB Simulink, and their performance was evaluated under real environmental conditions with fluctuating irradiance and temperature. The results demonstrate that conventional techniques, such as incremental conductance (INC), Perturb and Observe (P&O), Incremental conductance and Particle Swam Optimization (INC-PSO), Fuzzy Logic Control and Particle Swam Optimization (FLC-PSO), and Perturb and Observe and Particle Swam Optimization (P&O-PSO), achieved accuracies of 94%, 97.6%, 98.9%, 98.7%, and 99.3% respectively.

Compared to available research, which often reports lower accuracies for conventional techniques, our study highlights the enhanced performance of AI-based methods. This study provides a comprehensive comparative analysis, delivering critical analysis and practical guidance for engineers and researchers in selecting the most effective MPPT controller optimized to specific environmental conditions.

Wind power has emerged as an alternative that has contributed to the transition towards cleaner energy. As the importance of wind energy grows, it can be crucial to provide forecasts that optimize its performance potential. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have risen in prominence due to how well they can handle complicated systems while enhancing the accuracy of prediction. This study explored the area of AI to predict wind-energy production at a wind farm in Yalova, Turkey, using four different AI approaches: support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Wind speed and direction were considered as essential input parameters, with wind energy as the target parameter, and models are thoroughly evaluated using metrics such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The findings accentuate the superior performance of the SVM, which delivered the lowest MAPE (2.42%), the highest R2 (0.95), and the lowest MAE (71.21%) compared with actual values, while ANFIS was less effective in this context.

In the proposed system, a current fed converter is implemented for the photovoltaic and supercapacitor which is a power electronic converter that operates by controlling the current flow in the circuit. The benefit of these converters is that core saturation and shot through cannot lead to device failure or half cycle symmetry. This is a feature of silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) based converters and is a key factor in the increased durability of these converters. A power bi-directional converter is employed for the battery in the EV system. This converter enables the battery to both charge and discharge power as required by the system which facilitates the energy flow between the battery and the rest of the system, allowing efficient energy management and utilization within the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Additionally, to efficiently utilize the photovoltaic system, an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to determine the maximum power points (MPPs). A robust nonlinear higher order super twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) and integral terminal sliding mode controller (ITSMC) have been designed for PHEVs to reduced chattering phenomena.

However, increasing energy demand and population growth have intensified the emission of biological pollutants due to fossil fuel use. The Global Alliance on Health and Pollution advocates for integrating renewable energy sources to mitigate these issues. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the integration of a solar-biomass polygeneration system with a hybrid solar-waste-fossil fuel cogeneration system. The goal is to analyze the system from technical, economic, and environmental perspectives, focusing on optimizing energy demand and minimizing environmental impact. Methods: To assess energy demand and supply, the R-curve methodology was applied to the hybrid cogeneration system, with a specific focus on solar and biomass renewable energies.

The central concept revolves around rule-based control strategies designed to exploit wastewater's heat, accounting for a substantial amount of the total heating demand in residential buildings. The system is also integrated with heat pumps to recover the radiators' return water energy to preheat the ventilation air passively. Naturally-driven borehole thermal energy storage is added for post-cooling the ventilation air to incorporate higher renewable shares in building energy systems while lowering CO2 emission. TRNSYS and MATLAB software are used to design, control, optimize, and assess the system's performance from technological, environmental, and economic perspectives with the aid of artificial intelligence. According to the results, the proposed smart system is superior due to higher efficiency and lower energy cost while saving CO2 emissions compared to the conventional ventilation system. The results further show that the suggested smart integration effectively meets needs and reduces dependency on the centralized energy network by independently recovering or producing thermal energy through the developed control framework. According to the artificial neural network-assisted optimization outcomes, energy cost, total cost, and CO2 index are reduced by about 41.5 USD.MWh−1, 10,306 USD, and 1.7 kg.MWh−1, respectively. Furthermore, there is an annual extra 3 kWh of improved energy generation thanks to the optimal storage/usage of energy. The results further show that strategic optimization techniques like reducing mass flow rate and borehole depth perform well to maximize efficiency while reducing environmental impact and saving significant money. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Clean energy system; Geothermal energy; Multi-objective optimization; Optimal control framework; Wastewater heat recovery; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Borehole thermal energy storage; Clean energy systems; CO 2 emission; Energy; Energy cost; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimal control frameworks; Residential building; Ventilation airs; Wastewater heat recovery; Geothermal energy,Elsevier Ltd,2352152X (ISSN),English,J.

However, the large-scale involvement of green energy leads to the creation of distributed energy networks that combine several different generation methods, each of which has its own specific features, and as a result, the data collection and processing necessary to optimize the operation of such energy systems become more relevant. Development of new technologies for the more optimal use of RES is one of the main tasks of modern research in the field of energy, where an important place is assigned to the use of technologies based on artificial intelligence, allowing researchers to significantly increase the efficiency of the use of all types of RES within energy systems. This paper proposes to consider the methodology of application of modern approaches to the assessment of the amount of energy obtained from renewable energy sources based on artificial intelligence technologies, approaches used for data processing and for optimization of the control processes for operating energy systems with the integration of renewable energy sources. The relevance of the work lies in the formation of a general approach applied to the evaluation of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy based on the use of artificial intelligence technologies. As a verification of the approach considered by the authors, a number of models for predicting the amount of solar power generation using photovoltaic panels have been implemented, for which modern machine-learning methods have been used.

The efficiency of this decision-making process relies on accurate modeling. In this paper, reinforcement learning (RL), an artificial intelligence-based approach, is proposed to optimize the energy management system (EMS) of an energy hub (EH). This EH contains renewable energy resources (RER), a combined heat and power (CHP), and a gas furnace. In order to meet electrical and thermal energy demand, available options such as day-ahead and real-time purchases from the main grid, RERs, and natural gas consumption are managed, with the preference of RERs to minimize GHG emissions and energy costs. With the adaptable RL method, a non-linear model of the CHP operation is constructed, considering the operational costs of the CHP. Furthermore, the natural gas tariff is varied according to the consumption level of the microgrid. Finally, this paper presents an RL-based method for EMS optimization of an EH with day-ahead and real-time scheduling, applied to a 24-hour case study with linear and nonlinear modeling of the problem and sensitivity analysis of the parameters.

However, early optimization strategies were overly simplistic and lacked automated updating and iterative capabilities. With the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have applied deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to system operations. However, the optimization focus has been limited to the internal systems, lacking global optimization. In this paper, a global optimization control strategy based on the Dueling double-deep Q network (D3QN) and value decomposition network (VDN) algorithms is proposed to make the DCs system operate more closely with the upstream, midstream, and downstream. By adjusting battery charging/discharging capacity, computational workload, and waste heat utilization heating temperature global synergistic optimization is achieved. Compared with without optimization, renewable energy waste, operation cost, total electricity consumption, and grid electricity consumption are reduced by 18.37%, 9.78%, 4.01%, and 29.74%, respectively. Additionally, a detailed comparison between non-algorithmic optimization and algorithmic optimization is provided, offering valuable insights for substantial energy savings and emissions reduction in DCs. The results demonstrate the importance of fully exploring the interactive potential between upstream energy supply, midstream computational workload, and downstream waste heat recovery to achieve synergistic global optimization of “computing power"", “thermal energy"" and “electrical energy"" for the sustainable and green development of DCs or other prosumer buildings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",D3QN; Data center system; Global cooperative optimization; VDN; Computing power; Deep learning; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy conservation; Green computing; Iterative methods; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Cooperative optimization; D3QN; Data center systems; Decomposition networks; Global cooperative optimization; Global optimisation; Systems operation; Value decomposition; Value decomposition network; Global optimization,Elsevier Ltd,23527102 (ISSN),English,J.

Various combinations of the attached household appliances lead to specific operating states, related to the charge and load switching-time in different out-side conditions. Complexity and irregularities require modelling with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to represent the uncertainty in load transitions and RE power oscillations. These specifics cannot be numerically solved with respect to unexpected states in detached micro-grid systems showing great variability. Recent Differential Learning, developed by the author, using a novel designed neuro-computing approach, enables one to model high non-linear and indefinable chaotic physical systems. The optimal training periods of day-set records were initially pre-assessed, based on AI input-output statistics. This model initialization allows operable day-ahead PQ-predictions in processing the last 24-hour series in one sequence. The proposed 2-level PQ-management evaluates initial load scheduling plans, based on available RE and storage sources. System efficiency and failure-free operations are planned considering the first estimate of its day-ahead PVP supply and secondary PQ verification of the provided load utilization schemes, under various state charges and RE production limits. This is a novelty with a notable incremental improvement in the published combinatorial optimization algorithms, only scheduling applicable load components, and reassessing the allowable power-day resources. Off-grid optimal operations can be determined and regulated by an adequate early morning PQ evaluation in RE utilization.

The coordinated scheduling of these dispatchable resources with non-dispatchable resources can provide several techno-economic and social benefits. Since battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and microturbine units are capital intensive. A thorough investigation of their coordinated scheduling on a purely economic basis will be an interesting and challenging task while considering dynamic electricity price and uncertainty of renewable power generation and load demand. This paper proposes a new methodology for optimal coordinated scheduling of BESSs and microturbine units considering existing renewable energy resources and dynamic electricity price to maximize daily profit function of the utility. In this study, a recently explored modified African buffalo optimization algorithm is employed. The key attributes of the proposed methodology are comprised of mean price-based adaptive scheduling embedded within a decision mechanism system to maximize arbitrage benefits. Decision mechanism system keeps a track of system states as a-priori thus guides the artificial intelligence-based solution technique for sequential optimization. This may also reduce the computational burden of complex real-life engineering optimization problems. Further, a novel concept of fictitious charges in coordination with BESS management algorithm is proposed to restrict the counterproductive operational management of BESSs.

It contains the predictive of electricity consumption forms over certain time intervals. Load Forecasting remains a stimulating task as load data has exhibited changing patterns because of factors such as weather change and shifts in energy usage behaviour. The beginning of advanced data analytics and machine learning (ML) approaches; particularly deep learning (DL) has mostly enhanced load forecasting accuracy. Deep neural networks (DNNs) namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved popularity for their capability to capture difficult temporal dependencies in load data. This study designs a Short-Load Forecasting scheme using a Hybrid Deep Learning and Beluga Whale Optimization (LFS-HDLBWO) approach. The major intention of the LFS-HDLBWO technique is to predict the load in the SG environment. To accomplish this, the LFS-HDLBWO technique initially uses a Z-score normalization approach for scaling the input dataset. Besides, the LFS-HDLBWO technique makes use of convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory with an autoencoder (CBLSTM-AE) model for load prediction purposes. Finally, the BWO algorithm could be used for optimal hyperparameter selection of the CBLSTM-AE algorithm, which helps to enhance the overall prediction results. A wide-ranging experimental analysis was made to illustrate the better predictive results of the LFS-HDLBWO method. The obtained value demonstrates the outstanding performance of the LFS-HDLBWO system over other existing DL algorithms with a minimum average error rate of 3.43 and 2.26 under FE and Dayton grid datasets, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; bio-inspired algorithm; Energy management; hyperparameter optimization; short-term prediction; Brain; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Electric load forecasting; Electric power plant loads; Energy management systems; Long short-term memory; Renewable energy; Smart power grids; Beluga whales; Bio-inspired algorithms; Features extraction; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Load forecasting; Load modeling; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Short term prediction; Usability; Energy management,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536 (ISSN),English,IEEE Access,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: M.M.

AI techniques are used to design the optimal structure of a distributed generation system. The system includes wind and photovoltaic renewable energy sources, a battery bank, and an automated capacitor bank for power factor compensation. A case study was conducted in a real public building with an annual consumption of 1.748 GWh, which resulted in the specification of a distributed generation system with a generation of 2.805 GWh per year. This system meets approximately 160.5% of the building's electrical demand and 99.999% of annual energy costs, i.e., attending the nZEcB concept. The excess production of approximately 60% of the energy is necessary because the exported energy (feed-in tariff) has a lower value than that imported from the network, having to deduct costs with demand, in addition to having to compensate for losses in the battery banks. The project has a payback period of 6.79 years.

The integration of renewables could be suitable for this application and many solutions of solar-based lamps for street lighting are spreading. In this research work, a specific application of a PV-integrated lighting system was installed in the center of Italy along a footpath and monitored for several months, both in terms of electricity parameters and lighting behavior. It is equipped with monocrystalline photovoltaic cells, a lithium-based battery, and a LED lamp. The measured data allow the development of an optimization algorithm in Python program for the correct management of the solar streetlamp and the forecasting of electricity consumptions for different boundary conditions (e.g. Italian geographical position). The energy taken from grid in a year is very low with respect to a traditional lamp not powered by renewables: only 43-46% in central-northern regions and 35% in south region. Data are also used to study the possible substitution of all the traditional lamppost of the walkway with the novel proposed system. A technical-economic analysis is carried out to analyze the effectiveness of this solution not only in terms of electricity consumptions reduction, but also costs savings. The suitability of the investment and the payback time depend on Italian national price of electricity and initial cost of the solar lamp. The results can be applied to similar case studies in Italy to save electricity consumptions and reduce CO2 emissions. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; electricity consumptions; LED; optimization algorithm; photovoltaic (PV); storage; streetlamp; technical-economic analysis; Artificial intelligence; Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Light emitting diodes; Lithium batteries; Optimization; Photoelectrochemical cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Battery; Electricity-consumption; Energy-consumption; Green products; Optimization algorithms; Optimization method; Pedestrian; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy source; Streetlamp; Technical-economic analysis; Technology managements; Investments,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536 (ISSN),English,IEEE Access,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: E.

This paper proposes a new and flexible model for optimising operational decisions in watershed systems with interconnected dams. We propose a systematic representation of watersheds by a network of different connection points, which is the basis for an efficient Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. The model is designed to be adaptable to different connections between dams in both main and tributary rivers. It supports decisions on power generation, pumping and water discharge, maximising profit, and considering realistic constraints on water use and factors such as future energy prices and weather conditions. A relax-and-fix heuristic is proposed to solve the model, along with two heuristic variants to accommodate different watershed structures and sizes. Methodological tests with simulated instances validate their performance, with both variants achieving results within 1% of the optimal solution faster than the model for the tested instances. To evaluate the performance of the approaches in a real-world scenario, we analyse the case study of the Cávado watershed (Portugal), providing relevant insights for managing dam operations. The model generally follows the actual decisions made in typical situations and flood scenarios. However, in the case of droughts, it tends to be more conservative, saving water unless necessary or profitable. The model can be used in a decision-support system to provide decision-makers with an integrated view of the entire watershed and optimised solutions to the operational problem at hand. © 2024 The Author(s)",Interconnected dams; MILP; Optimisation; Relax-and-fix; Watershed system; Portugal; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Costs; Decision making; Decision support systems; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Integer programming; Profitability; Watersheds; Energy production sector; Hydropower plants; Interconnected dam; MILP; Operational decision making; Optimisations; Performance; Relax and fixes; Renewable energies; Watershed system; dam; decision making; decision support system; numerical model; optimization; watershed; Dams,Elsevier Ltd,03062619 (ISSN),English,Appl.

The importance of each element and the interaction between them leads to think about a decision-making strategy. In fact, the integration of a Photovoltaic Panel (PVP) is used due to its availability and its participation in the carbon emissions reduction. Also, a battery is required to fill a power gap or absorb extra generated energy. Moreover, an optimal sizing is needed to get an efficient system with minimum cost. Also, an energy management strategy (EMS) is essential to ensure the power resources scheduling in order to keep a continuous equilibrium supply-demand of electricity and avoid instabilities in the grid, with guaranteeing a minimum cost of electricity. In the first part, the proposed smart grid optimal sizing is determined under real weather data (solar radiation) of the city of Sousse, Tunisia, using the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software technique. This approach is chosen thanks to its simplicity, effectiveness, and high precision compared to traditional techniques. In this paper, several configurations (Grid, (Grid-battery), (Grid-PVP), (Grid-PVP-battery)) are studied. The obtained results prove that the (Grid-PVP-battery) system configuration is the most efficient and economical solution. In the second part, a robust energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed for two smart grid configurations (grid-battery, grid-PVP-battery). This strategy is based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) thanks to its non-linear modelling and its ability to make decisions relating to energy management. The primary goal of the suggested (EMS) is to ensure the energy resources scheduling in order to keep a continuous equilibrium among the production and consumption of electricity and avoid instabilities in the grid, with guaranteeing a minimum cost of electricity. As input data, (FLC) used time-varying price electricity (Price (t)) to solve an instant decision problem by choosing, at each instant, the optimal energy source (which provide electricity at the cheapest price possible). The obtained results, carrying out Matlab simulation, prove the efficacy of the proposed strategy, not only, in the energy resources scheduling to meet the load, but also, for the system cost reduction since the PVP has been used as much as possible since it is inexpensive relative to the costs of battery capacity and the grid. © The Author(s) 2024.",artificial intelligence; battery; decision-making; energy management strategy; fuzzy logic control; hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources; photovoltaic panel; reliable; sizing; smart grid; switch; Battery management systems; Benchmarking; Budget control; Competitive intelligence; Convex optimization; Costs; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Dynamic frequency scaling; Dynamic programming; Empowerment of personnel; Enterprise resource planning; Industrial relations; Industrial waste disposal; Industrial waste treatment; Input output programs; Integer programming; Job analysis; Lean production; Markup languages; Nuclear batteries; Phosphate deposits; Power management (telecommunication); Product development; Quality of service; Refuse digestion; Renewable energy; Resource allocation; Risk management; Sales; Six sigma; Smart power grids; Strategic planning; Taxation; Total quality management; Virtual storage; Voltage scaling; Water treatment; Battery; Decisions makings; Energy; Energy management strategy; Fuzzy logic control; Hybrid optimization; Hybrid optimization of multiple energy resource; Management strategies; Photovoltaic panels; Reliable; Sizing; Smart grid; MATLAB,SAGE Publications Ltd,1063293X (ISSN),English,Concurrent Eng Res Appl,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: F.B.

However, older generations using boilers represent a large proportion of systems currently in operation, and significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, operational data has become increasingly available for these older generation systems and represents a suitable opportunity for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based modelling and advanced controls. In this context, model predictive control (MPC) has appeared as a powerful control solution; however, field implementation remains relatively scarce. This paper aims to develop an AI-based MPC strategy for multi-boiler district heating systems. It relies on heating load forecasting machine learning models and data-driven boiler performance curves to optimize boiler thermal outputs. This strategy was implemented in two Canadian demonstration sites and showed GHG emissions reductions of 1.3 % and 2.8 %. Although relatively modest, statistical analysis confirmed the realization of these savings. In absolute terms, the strategy helped avoid 45 t and 77 t CO2eq emissions and save $10,268 and $19,975 CAD during the testing period of 2–3 months.

Otherwise, significant power variations on the tie-line connecting the MG to the main power grid could occur. This study introduces an innovative scheduling strategy that utilizes a data-driven approach, employing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve this smoothing effect. The strategy prioritizes the scheduling of MG's internal power devices, taking into account the stochastic charging patterns of electric vehicles. The scheduling optimization model is initially described as a Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing power fluctuations on the interconnection lines and operational costs of the MG. Subsequently, after preprocessing the historical operational data of the MG, an enhanced scheduling strategy is developed through a neural network learning process. Finally, the results from four scheduling scenarios demonstrate the significant impact of the proposed strategy. Comparisons of reward curves before and after data preprocessing underscore its importance. In contrast to optimization results from deep deterministic policy gradient, soft actor-critic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms, the superiority of the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with the addition of a priority experience replay mechanism is highlighted. © 2024 The Author(s).

Meeting this escalating energy need poses a substantial challenge, especially the difficulty in constructing new conventional power plants due to limited fossil fuel resources. To address this, demand-side management (DSM) in smart grid (SG), integrated with solar photovoltaic energy (SPE) have emerged as a crucial tool for effectively managing electricity demand, ensuring flexibility and reliability. DSM achieves optimal electricity utilization by rescheduling the operation schedules of consumer appliances and carefully adjusting their demand profiles. Integrating DSM into a smart grid framework is highly advantageous for the power industry’s pursuit of sustainable energy goals. While various heuristic-based optimization techniques have been employed for DSM, the focus on SPE has been limited to small-scale residential loads. This study utilizes the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to tackle a day ahead DSM minimization problem, considering SPE in areas with large number of appliances. The DSM minimization problem falls into the category of discrete combinatorial problems, making it well-suited for ACO optimization. The self-healing, self-protection, and self-organizing attributes of ACO make it particularly effective for DSM solutions. Residential, commercial, and industrial loads, with and without SPE integration, are considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ACO algorithm. Simulation results are compared with other studies in the literature, including Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO), in terms of reducing consumer’s cost of energy (CCE) and utility peak load (UPL).

Therefore, multi-MG systems are proposed to achieve more optimality with stability. However, the EMS yet faces more uncertainties due to the increased number of renewable energy resources in multi-microgrids. Therefore, the use of a battery energy storage system (BESS) is crucial to manage these uncertainties. BESSs impose huge investment and operation costs, so it is important to consider their optimal planning and operation to maximize their benefits and lifespan. Model-based optimization approaches are used by formulating the EMS problem based on the complete system models under uncertainties. However, this assumption is usually impractical due to the prohibitive complexity and computational burden of solving a large nonlinear problem with many uncertain variables subject to privacy policies. This paper employs the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to handle uncertainties associated with the large number of uncertain variables in EMS for multi-MG systems. An auxiliary cloud-fog computing framework is proposed for the DRL agents, which includes sufficient storage space, computational resources, and communication infrastructure among MGs. Simulation results in Matlab reveal that the optimality of the EMS is improved by 15 % on average by utilizing the auxiliary computing framework. © 2024 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Battery energy storage system; Cloud-fog computing; Deep reinforcement learning; Energy management system; Microgrid; Uncertainties; Battery storage; Deep learning; Electric batteries; Energy management; Fog computing; Investments; Learning systems; MATLAB; Microgrids; Operating costs; Reinforcement learning; Renewable energy; Battery energy storage systems; Cloud-fog computing; Computing frameworks; Deep reinforcement learning; Microgrid; Microgrid systems; Multi micro-grids; Optimality; Reinforcement learnings; Uncertainty; Energy management systems,Elsevier Ltd,2352152X (ISSN),English,J.

Several time-domain simulations are carried out in EMTP-RV to extract time-synchronized current and voltage data. The Stockwell transform (ST) was used in MATLAB/SIMULINK to preprocess these input datasets to train the adaptive fault diagnosis deep convolutional neural network (AFDDCNN) for fault location identification, fault type identification, and fault phase-detection for different penetration levels. Based on the AFDDCNN output, the intelligent protection scheme (IDOCPS) generates the signal for isolating a faulty section of the ADN. An intelligent fault diagnosis scheme that combines ST and deep learning methods aids the artificial intelligence-based protection scheme in isolating the faulty section. This study uses the PyTorch framework to build both the AFDDCNN and IDOCPS. The proposed protection technique classifies and isolates faults and coordinates protection with minimum operating time in the IEEE 13-bus ADN. It consistently gives high accuracy for fault diagnosis and minimum operating time for the IDOCPS even when the network’s topology is modified to the IEEE 34-bus ADN.

However, the power they generate is highly variable, leading to unpredictable fluctuations in power supply. Additionally, advanced smart functions in consumer devices and their unpredictable usage patterns contribute to similar fluctuations in power consumption. These fluctuations present a significant challenge to the stability and quality of the power grid, creating a complex issue of power imbalance that becomes harder to manage. Innovative management and control approaches are necessary to address these challenges and thus support the shift to sustainable energy sources. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly proposed as promising solutions, albeit mostly implemented as isolated solutions within centralized power control systems. To effectively manage the complex and often large scale power systems, this paper advocates the use of a Distributed AI (DAI) framework as imperative in enhancing their agility and stability.

However, optimizing EV charging to align with grid stability and renewable energy availability remains a challenge. To address this challenge, this study introduces a machine learning-based framework to optimize EV charging by considering driver satisfaction - a novel approach quantifying this multidimensional construct through socio-demographic attributes, State of Charge (SoC), proximity to charging stations, and variable charging fees. Driver satisfaction is defined as the extent to which the EV charging experience aligns with drivers' expectations, integrating these key factors to influence decision-making and overall happiness with the charging service. Trained on a dataset from Hungarian EV users, the developed model predicts outcomes with high accuracy (87.9%), leading to an optimization algorithm that maximizes driver satisfaction while minimizing grid power purchase costs. Our results from a simulated smart grid demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an average charging satisfaction score of 98.5% compared to 69.54% from a traditional method. Additionally, the proposed method maintained the SoC of the EV fleet at a stable average around 50%, optimizing energy use and grid stability. By dynamically assigning EVs to charging stations and leveraging photovoltaic sources, our solution not only boosts driver satisfaction but also aids in the sustainable growth of smart grids.

As the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. Exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar-powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). Based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. The studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. The present work's main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. Energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two-objective optimization were extracted. Parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed system's performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. In addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. To find the best values of decision variables, multi-objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. The results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 $/h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 $/h). The outcomes of this work can play a critical role for higher education institutions in advancing innovative solutions to pressing energy challenges.

ZVS range and efficiency are two significant performance indicators for the DAB converter. To obtain the desired ZVS and efficiency performance, modulation should be carefully designed. Hybrid modulation (HM) considers several single modulation strategies to achieve good comprehensive performance. Conventionally, to design an HM, a harmonic approach or piecewise approach is used, but they suffer from a time-consuming model-building process and inaccuracy. Therefore, an artificial-intelligence-based hybrid extended phase shift (HEPS) modulation is proposed. Generally, the HEPS modulation is developed in an automated fashion, which alleviates the cumbersome model-building process while keeping high model accuracy. In HEPS modulation, two EPS strategies are considered to realize optimal efficiency with full ZVS operation over entire operating ranges. Specifically, to build data-driven models of ZVS and efficiency performance, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), which is a state-of-the-art ensemble learning algorithm, is adopted. Afterward, particle swarm optimization with state-based adaptive velocity limit (PSO-SAVL) is utilized to select the best EPS strategy and optimize modulation parameters. With 1-kW hardware experiments, the feasibility of HEPS has been verified, achieving optimal efficiency with a maximum of 97.1% and full-range ZVS operation. © 2023 IEEE.

In order to deal with the unpredictable energy inputs from renewables, the micro gas turbine must be capable of running under varying load conditions and making fast transitions between them. The operation of a micro gas turbine in an integrated microgrid (MG) has the potential to reduce operational costs and ensure the delivery of demanded heat and power to consumers. This paper investigates the operation of a micro gas turbine in a MG, serving as a supplementary power source for a municipal building. The building’s required energy is initially provided by wind turbine power, and the micro gas turbine serves as a backup source during times of wind power deficiency. The micro gas turbine can operate using a natural gas/hydrogen fuel blend ranging from zero to 100% hydrogen. Furthermore, a water electrolyzer with a hydrogen tank is available to operate as a storage system within the MG. The study’s results demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of using hydrogen storage and optimizing operational planning in the MG.

However, minimizing energy conception, charging time, and increasing the remaining energy is the main contest for the development of EVs among traditional vehicles. In this research, an optimized scheduling technique named the Smart Decision-Hunting optimization (SDHO) algorithm is proposed for determining the available charging stations. The proposed SDHO-based scheduling scheme is used to determine the optimal CS for charging EVs. The suggested SDHO-based charge scheduling scheme is authenticated by vehicular Adhoc network simulation and attains better performance by considering the maximum number of vehicles. The system paradigm for electric vehicle charge scheduling management aims to select the most relevant charging station that requires the least amount of service time for the EV driver since the search of charging station and the waiting time may cause time delay and energy drain. The SDHO algorithm is based on swarm intelligence-based optimization approaches to start a high-level solution based on the first random population of feasible solutions and their fitness function. The Cervus deer strategy was used to enhance the performance of the electric vehicle charge schedule by using the combined characteristics of the Casanova wolf and the Cervus deer. SDHO-based charging scheduling scheme uses communal grading, bordering, stalking, detecting, and ceasing phases. The fitness function is evaluated by concerning parameters like average waiting time, and minimum distance of charging at a charging station. The proposed SDHO-based Charge scheduling scheme achieves the lowest average waiting time of 0.34 min, charged vehicles of 8, a distance of 27.812 km, and the highest remaining energy of 53.934 w, which shows the highest performance than the existing models.Thus, the proposed method provided better charge scheduling for electric vehicles, which stands as an advantage for E-Vehicle charging stations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Electric vehicle; Fitness; Smart decision-hunting optimization (SDHO); Vehicular adhoc network; Charging (batteries); Climate change; Grading; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Ad-hoc networks; Charging station; Fitness; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Performance; Remaining energies; Scheduling schemes; Smart decision-hunting optimization; Vehicular adhoc network; Electric vehicles,Springer-Verlag Italia s.r.l.,19552513 (ISSN),English,Int.

In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a pivotal tool for addressing model-based decision-making challenges, courtesy of its rapid and efficient computational capabilities. This paper proposes a comprehensive HSC model consisting of an economic policy planner, a wholesale hydrogen market, a power supply system, a hydrogen distribution system (HDS), and hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs). It leverages an AI circular hydrogen economist approach based on a hierarchical deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, offering a new alternative to traditional multi-objective bi-level optimization platforms. The model incorporates green, blue, and gray hydrogen production processes as viable hydrogen production pathways, with the hierarchical MARL's agents representing the HDS and HRSs at two decision-making levels. Energy requirements are met through a combination of on-site renewable energy sources, the main power grid, or distributed power generation systems. Several HSC scenarios are examined with respect to various combinations of green hydrogen supply rates and carbon credits granted to them under optimum conditions. The results showed that the developed hierarchical MARL has the potential to replace mathematical programming (MP), uncovering a new economic-environmental trade-off between profit of HDS and operational costs of HRSs. Notably, green hydrogen transactions exponentially increase within the supply chain as the carbon credits exceed $1 per kilogram of hydrogen.

These meteorological conditions such as solar irradiance, temperature, and wind speed are nonlinear and stochastic, thus affecting the estimation of solar photovoltaic (PV) power. Accurate estimation of photovoltaic power is essential for enhancing the functioning of solar power installations. The paper aims to develop a novel deep learning-based photovoltaic power prediction model on different weather conditions. The proposed model utilises a two-stage deep learning framework for accurate solar PV power prediction, which combines the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning architectures. The key role of CNN layer is to identify the weather conditions, i.e., sunny, partially cloudy, and extremely cloudy, while the LSTM layer learns the patterns of solar power generation that depend on weather variations to estimate photovoltaic power. The proposed hybrid models consider meteorological factors, such as wind speed, irradiance, temperature, and humidity, including cloud cover and UV index to provide precise solar PV power prediction. The presented hybrid model has better performance metrices having root mean square error of 0.0254, 0.03465, and 0.0824, mean square error of 0.000645, 0.00120, and 0.00679, R2 of 0.9898, 0.9872, and 0.9358, and mean average error of 0.0163, 0.0236, and 0.2521 for sunny, partially cloudy, and extremely cloudy weather conditions, respectively. The results demonstrate that presented deep learning-based novel solar PV power prediction model can accurately predict solar PV power based on instantaneous changes in generated power patterns and aid in the optimisation of PV power plant operations.

Hence, this article introduces a new BIPV/T system to optimally minimize the energy consumption of a household residential building. The meticulous design of the proposed BIPV/T system is accomplished through MATLAB/Simulink® dynamic modeling. Performance analysis for the BIPV/T system is performed under different seasonal conditions with in-depth techno-economic analyses to estimate the expected enhancement in the thermal, electrical, and economic performance of the system. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the impact of various factors on the energetic and economic performances of the proposed BIPV/T system. More so, the two-layer feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network modeling is developed to accurately predict the hourly solar radiation and ambient temperature for the BIPV/T. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization using the NSGA-II method is also conducted for the minimization of the total BIPV/T plant area and maximization of the total efficiency and net thermal power of the system as well as to estimate the optimized operating conditions for input variables across different seasons within the provided ranges. The sensitivity analysis revealed that higher solar flux levels lead to increased electric output power of the BIPV/T plant, but total efficiency decreases due to higher thermal losses. Moreover, the proposed NSGA-II shows a feasible method to attain a maximum net thermal power and optimal total efficiency of 5320 W and 63% with a minimal total plant area of 32.89 m2 that attained a very low deviation index from the ideal solution. The levelised cost of electricity is obtained as 0.10 $/kWh under the optimal conditions.

One of the pivotal challenges lies in the clustering of MGs, a complex task aimed at enhancing their robustness and economic performance during events. However, limited research has been conducted on this intricate clustering problem. This study addresses this gap by proposing an artificial intelligence-based method tailored for MG clustering. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-objective optimization approach to determine the optimal clustering of standalone MGs. Our methodology considers a range of critical parameters, including distributed generation (DG) droop settings, DG locations and capacities, renewable energy resources from solar units and wind turbines, capacitors, and power transmission lines. By minimizing power losses and enhancing voltage stability, we identify a virtual cut-set line, often referred to as the ""virtual line,"" characterized by minimal power exchange between clustered MGs. To achieve optimal and cost-effective performance, we develop an enhanced differential genetic evolution algorithm designed to address multi-objective problems within stringent constraints. Additionally, we employ Bayesian theory within artificial intelligence to estimate the optimal output power of renewable energy sources, specifically wind turbines and solar panels. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to a 69-bus MG across various scenarios.

This study presents a new methodology that integrates meteorological forecasts to estimate renewable energy production through mathematical models and from the day-ahead demands forecast, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is applied to optimize the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) parameters to minimize the total VPPs energy costs. Additionally, a smart contract was written in Solidity and implements user registration, an oracle mechanism to integrate real-world data on-chain, such as Time-of-Use (TOU) prices and feed-in tariffs. An optimization-based profit distribution algorithm is employed to distribute the value generated by the Demand Side Management (DSM) operation among all participants, utilizing Load Factor and a modified Peak-to-Average Ratio. The study case results show a cost reduction of 22.63%, the energy consumption at the peak periods reduced by 48.67%, and 83.53% of the energy exported into the grid, due to the aggregation of the CUs and the BESS implementation. Results from DSM's blockchain-based system have achieved savings for consumer units ranging from 10.41% to 114.80%. The savings of 114.80% represents a nominal profit of 14.80% compared to the previous cost (without DSM). The profit distribution mechanism plays an important role in encouraging consumer units to improve their demand profile in order to maximize the efficiency of the DSM system and consequently obtain financial benefits.

The optimal energy management strategy can be significantly affected by the intermittency of renewable energies and also harsh weather conditions. In this study, a novel snow conditions-compatible computational intelligence-based short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting (PVPF) approach is proposed that is independent of exogenous weather forecasts. The proposed approach consists of a snow cover detection stage, a snow cover forecasting stage, and a PV power forecasting stage. This approach is then validated for a model predictive control (MPC)-based energy management system (EMS) of a PV energy-based grid-connected microgrid located in a snow-prone area. The PVPF method together with a computational intelligence-based short-term load demand forecasting model constitutes the forecasting block of the EMS. The forecasting block generates day-ahead hourly forecasts based on the local measurements of the meteorological-electrical parameters and sends them to the optimisation block where a two-stage control method, corresponding to the tertiary and secondary control levels, is developed based on mixed-integer linear and quadratic programming. The developed EMS is applied to a test microgrid simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and compared with a heuristic control method. The results show that the proposed approach can reduce the overall operation cost of the microgrid by 8% (24$), 15% (166$), and 13% (235$) on sunny, cloudy, and snowy days under study, respectively, compared to the heuristic controller. © 2023 The Authors.

Moreover, due to the depletion of fossil fuels, it is very difficult to manage the demand requirement of the SAARC regions, which leads to significant power shortage issues. These problems would be resolved through the integration of the substantial amount of renewable energy resources (RERs) that are available in excess in the SAARC regions into the power system networks. This will provide a futuristic roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment in the SAARC region. In this regard, the SAARC region has devised a new plan to transform its smart grid infrastructure into the super smart grid (SSG), which would connect the SAARC countries using the high voltage transmission lines utilizing each country's substantial RERs. To accelerate this ecofriendly effort, the key objective of this review study is to evaluate the potential of the SAARC SSG for demand management and emissions reduction. This study provides a comprehensive overview of SSG technology, covering its technical background, management, power flow improvement techniques, power stability techniques, simulation models, and future steps for development in the SAARC region. First, the regional conflicts, energy deficiency, and potential of the SAARC region have been discussed. Second, a potential architecture of the SAARC SSG has been simulated. Third, a novel Markov chain modeling has been presented for demand management in the SAARC regions. The results and discussions section presents findings from simulations and models. The paper also discusses CO2 reduction techniques, including methods for capturing, storing, and utilizing carbon in biofuel. The study also discusses futuristic optimization techniques in SSG, including blockchain, federated learning, reinforcement learning, the metaverse, digital twin technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The SSG challenges and limitations section summarizes the challenges and limitations faced by SSG. Finally, a roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment for the SAARC power grids has been identified to support the implementation of the futuristic SAARC SSG.

This literature review emphasises the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in predicting solar energy potential. While traditional ANNs with single hidden layers and predefined neuron configurations have shown success in various applications, they are not suitable for predicting nonlinear time-series databases in the context of this research. The limitations of traditional ANNs in predicting solar power potential necessitate the exploration of alternative approaches. Configuring the structure of traditional ANNs for solar power prediction is a time-consuming process that often requires manual or trial-and-error methods. To address this issue, optimisation techniques are incorporated into the ANN model. Various traditional methods have been explored in this research, but none has achieved satisfactory performance. Drawing from experiences with traditional techniques, a novel Evolution of Cub to Predator (ECP) technique is proposed. The investigation results demonstrate that the incorporation of optimisation techniques yields superior performance compared to traditional ANNs. The proposed ECP technique achieves an impressive prediction accuracy of 97.2%, surpassing existing optimisation techniques.

Given the uncertainty and stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) and loads, dynamic pricing strategies are required to minimize instant energy shortage risks and ensure energy balancing. This study introduces an optimal adaptive control methodology based on an elastic demand control mechanism using dynamic pricing to address energy balancing in renewable smart microgrids. The proposed optimal adaptive controller, referred to as the ant colony optimization algorithm tuned super-twisting sliding mode controller (ACO-STSMC), effectively handles system nonlinearities and enhances the response of the system to uncertainties and variability of RESs and loads. The ACO-STSMC regulates energy price signals, manages the net load demand, and responds to RESs generation fluctuations, ultimately achieving and maintaining an energy balance in renewable energy smart microgrids. The system exhibits a minimal mismatch between generation and demand, avoids instant demand overshots, and maintains low-energy pricing signal volatility. The findings demonstrate that the developed ACO-STSMC outperforms benchmark controllers such as PSO-PI, PSO-FOPI, PSO-STSMC, ACO-PI, and ACO-FOPI in terms of energy balancing in renewable-energy smart microgrids.

Because of this, renewable energy sources have come to the forefront, and the research interest in microgrids that rely on distributed generation and storage systems has exploded. Furthermore, many new markets for energy trading, ancillary services, and frequency reserve markets have provided attractive investment opportunities in exchange for balancing the supply and demand of electricity. Artificial intelligence can be utilized to locally optimize energy consumption, trade energy with the main grid, and participate in these markets. Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most promising approaches to achieve this goal because it enables an agent to learn optimal behavior in a microgrid by executing specific actions that maximize the long-term reward signal/function. The study focuses on testing two optimization algorithms: logic-based optimization and reinforcement learning. This paper builds on the existing research framework by combining PPO with machine learning-based load forecasting to produce an optimal solution for an industrial microgrid in Norway under different pricing schemes, including day-ahead pricing and peak pricing. It addresses the peak shaving and price arbitrage challenges by taking the historical data into the algorithm and making the decisions according to the energy consumption pattern, battery characteristics, PV production, and energy price. The RL-based approach is implemented in Python based on real data from the site and in combination with MATLAB-Simulink to validate its results. The application of the RL algorithm achieved an average monthly cost saving of 20% compared with logic-based optimization.

Therefore, if well developed and implemented, a microgrid system with an integrated energy storage system (ESS) installed in hospitals has great potential to provide an uninterrupted and low-energy cost solution. In this article, we target to show the importance of the installed ESS against the problems that will arise from power outages and energy quality problems in hospitals. Besides, it aims to construct an energy management system (EMS) based on the scheduling model to meet the lowest cost of a system containing solar panels, microturbine, gas boiler, and energy storage units that are repurposed lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles and thermal storage tank. EMS is a mixed-integer linear program to meet the hospital's electricity, heating, and cooling demands with the lowest cost for every hour. The established scheduling model is run for a hospital in Antioch, Türkiye, with 197 beds, 4 operating rooms, 2 resuscitation units, and 9 intensive care units for every hour based on the data in 2019. With the EMS, approximately 25% savings were achieved compared to the previous energy cost.

As an alternative to achieving carbon neutrality, electric vehicles (EVs) are deemed as the goal of vehicle transformation to achieve zero carbon emissions. However, the challenges of EV energy supplementation have not been adequately investigated, causing concerns about range anxiety, inconvenience of perceived charging service, and so on. By identifying stakeholders and investigating various services under the umbrella of electro-mobility (E-Mobility) services, this article first introduces the concept, population, and challenges of EVs as the key enabler of E-Mobility and then summarizes recent E-Mobility services with holistic insight. Then, overviews of plug-in charging, battery swapping, vehicle-to-vehicle charging, and mobile and wireless charging are introduced, including the objectives, risks, and service optimization categories. Further to the literature review, concern on identifying the gap between academia and industry application is also provided to help coach the technology transformation. From our review, it is observed that flexible and emerging service modes beyond plug-in charging have been receiving great attention from both academia and industry. Therefore, several recent market efforts have been showcased, by following the summarization of mainstream optimization methods applied for E-Mobility services.

It is, however, difficult to integrate wind energy into a mixed energy grid due to its high volatility and intermittency. For wind energy conversion systems to be reliable and efficient, accurate wind speed (WS) forecasting is fundamental. This study cascades a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) in order to obtain a model for hourly WS forecasting by utilizing several meteorological variables as model inputs to study their effects on predicted WS. For input selection, the mutation grey wolf optimizer (TMGWO) is used. For efficient optimization of CBiLSTM hyperparameters, a hybrid Bayesian Optimization and HyperBand (BOHB) algorithm is used. The combined usage of TMGWO, BOHB, and CBiLSTM leads to a three-phase hybrid model (i.e., 3P-CBiLSTM). The performance of 3P-CBiLSTM is benchmarked against the standalone and hybrid BiLSTMs, LSTMs, gradient boosting (GBRs), random forest (RFRs), and decision tree regressors (DTRs). The statistical analysis of forecasted WS reveals that the 3P-CBiLSTM is highly effective over the other benchmark forecasting methods. This objective model also registers the highest percentage of forecasted errors (≈ 53.4 – 81.8%) within the smallest error range ≤ |0.25| ms−1 amongst all tested study sites. Despite the remarkable results achieved, the CBiLSTM model cannot be generally understood, so the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) technique was used for explaining local and global model outputs, based on Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Both of the xAI methods determined that the antecedent WS is the most significant predictor of the short-term WS forecasting. Therefore, we aver that the proposed model can be employed to help wind farm operators in making quality decisions in maximizing wind power integration into the grid with reduced intermittency. © 2024 The Author(s)",Bidirectional LSTM; Convolutional neural networks; eXplainable Artificial Intelligence; Feature selection; Wind speed forecasting,Elsevier Ltd,03062619 (ISSN),English,Appl.

Furthermore, there are further security concerns regarding the feasibility of incorporating bulk wind technology into the existing electrical grid, especially at the transmission level. This article summarizes the modifications made to the current protection system as a result of the integration of large wind farms. Signal distortions are studied in relation to the effects of dynamic fluctuations in the wind parameters, together with the fault and gearbox line parameters. The use of flexible AC gearbox systems (FACTS) and the integration of large amounts of wind energy have made the situation much worse. Different configurations of the potential solutions for such a gearbox system in the presence of both wind and FACT compensating devices are described. In addition to post-fault diagnosis problems brought on by structural changes in the power system, this research also illustrates fault detection of the transmission lines in the presence of bulk wind power. However, the plans put in place after taking the wind system into account need to be secure when the electricity system is running under stress. To demonstrate the impact of power swing and other stressed events, a review of the solutions is given. Useful techniques like signal processing and artificial intelligence are discussed, which are used to obtain enhanced solutions against conventional methods to get better solutions while protecting lines penetrated through wind farms and equipped with FACT devices.

Additionally, a methodology is proposed for modeling and analyzing a novel design to consider the uncertainty of production and demand with reverse risk in the design of residential microgrids. The proposed methodology focuses on the uncertainty of photovoltaic production and load demand by solving two-dimensional multipurpose optimization problem based on information gap decision theory (IGDT). In the mentioned approach, the photovoltaic generation's uncertainty and charge of photovoltaic generation are integrated into an equation to be solved as a problem. Regardless of the likelihood density function of uncertainty parameters and without preparing a firm framework, the current method integrates wind and photovoltaic production into the microgrids.

In this research, a cooling process based on a GAX system that uses ammonia-water working fluid and a hybrid source (natural gas-solar) is studied to analyze the variables that affect the system's thermal performance. The work's novelty is the hybridization between artificial intelligence (AI) modeling and the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) developed with the PAWN method. Experimental data was obtained from a system with a cooling capacity of 10.5 kW (3 Ton), designed to work at heat source temperatures of 200 °C. The measured variables were the temperatures at generator, heat at evaporator, and working fluid volumetric flow. Three AI techniques (artificial neural networks, genetic programming, and support vector machines) were evaluated for modeling the thermodynamic cycle. Results obtained from the PAWN method applied to the artificial neural network, since it was the best AI model, indicates that the operational parameters with a greater impact in the system's performance are the inlet temperature at the generator (30.7 %) and the heat measured at the evaporator for NH3 (27.4 %), for the first output COPNH3. For the second output COPH2O, the inlet temperature at the generator (32.5 %) and the and heat measured at the evaporator for H2O (26.7 %), have a greater impact for such output. The proposed IA-GSA methodology contributes to the development of operational decision-making related to instrumentation, operation performance, and corrective and/or preventive maintenance actions of GAX systems. The developed thermal performance model has potential for implementation in embedded systems (smart sensors) as a critical element in control and optimization strategies to improve the performance of these cycles. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Absorption refrigeration; Data-driven models; Decision-making process; Generator-Absorber Heat Exchange (GAX); Hybrid renewable energy system; PAWN method; Solar refrigeration cycle; Absorption refrigeration; Cooling systems; Decision making; Evaporators; Genetic algorithms; Heat exchangers; Neural networks; Sensitivity analysis; Support vector machines; Temperature; Data-driven model; Decision-making process; Energy systems; Generator-absorber heat exchange (GAX); Heat-exchange; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy system; PAWN method; Refrigeration cycles; Solar refrigeration cycle; Ammonia,Elsevier Ltd,13594311 (ISSN),English,Appl Therm Eng,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: O.

Because, Since the production of renewable energy sources is still in the process of being created, photovoltaic (PV) systems are commonly utilized for installation situations that are acceptable, clean, and simple. This study presents an adaptive artificial intelligence approach that can be used for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in solar systems with the help of an embedded controller. The adaptive method incorporates both the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The WOA was implemented to enhance the process of the ANN model's training, and the ANN model was developed using the WOA. In addition to this, the inverter circuit is connected to the smart grid system, and the strengthening of the smart grid is achieved through the implementation of the CMCMAC protocol. This protocol prevents interference between customers and the organizations that provide their utilities. Using a protocol known as Cross-Layer Multi-Channel MAC (CMCMAC), the effect of interference is removed using the way that was suggested. Also, with the utilization of the ZIGBEE communication technology, bidirectional communication is made possible. The strategy that was suggested has been put into practice, and the results have shown that the PV system produces an output power of 73.32KWand an efficiency of 98.72%. In addition to this, a built-in regulator is utilized to validate the proposed model. In this paper, the results of various experiments are analyzed, and a comparison is made between the suggested WOA with the ANN controller approach and others, such as the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based MPPT and the Cuckoo Search (CS) based MPPT. By examining the comparison findings, it was determined that the adaptive AI-based embedded controller was superior to the other alternatives. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

However, MEC-AD is still in the early stages of development, with numerous experimental studies but no modeling or optimization. Thus, to provide an effective modeling and optimization tool for this process, this study proposed applying artificial intelligence for the first time. The literature-based experimental data of MEC-AD fed with alkaline-pretreated waste-activated sludge (al-WAS) were used for this purpose. Accordingly, a two-hidden-layer artificial neural network (ANN) with topology 2–25–34–6, obtained from the response surface methodology, showed the best agreement between actual and predicted data with a low mean squared error of 0.0579 and a high R-value of 0.9870. This best ANN model was then optimized by particle swarm optimization. As a result, an Eapp of 0.63 V was found to be optimal for al-WAS-fed MEC-AD with a highest net energy output of 41.3 KJ/L-reactor (∼2.6 MJ/kg-WAS) and highest net monetary value of 0.72 $/L-reactor (∼45 $/kg-WAS), which enhanced around 160 % and 300 % compared to AD alone.

This work incorporates two techniques to ensure the stability of a boost converter through its state equations, implementing the inverse optimal control and the gain-scheduling technique for robust control settings. In such a way that, under a single adjustment, it is capable of damping different changes such as changes in the parameters, changes in the load, the input voltage, and the reference voltage. On the other hand, inverse optimal control is based on a discrete-time control Lyapunov function (CLF), and CLF candidate depends on fixed parameters that are selected to obtain the solution for inverse optimal control. Once these parameters have been found through heuristic or artificial intelligence methods, the new proposed methodology is capable of obtaining a robust optimal control scheme, without having to search for new parameters through other methods, since these are sometimes sensitive changes and many times the process of a new search is delayed. The results of the approach are simulated using Matlab, obtaining good performance of the proposed control under different operation conditions. Such simulations yielded errors of less than 1% based on the voltage reference, given the disturbances caused by changes in the input variables, system parameters, and changes in the reference. Thus, applying the new methodology, the stability of our system was preserved in all cases. © 2021 by the authors.

Consequently, traditional artificial intelligence approaches for detecting load anomalies tend to be relatively inaccurate or rely heavily on pre-processing optimization. Reasoning that hyperdimensional computing (HDC) lends itself naturally to classification with imbalanced datasets, we present an HDC-based method for detecting anomalies accurately and in real time using raw meter data without prior optimization. An associative memory is used to classify the hypervectors, providing resilience against data imbalance. Moreover, a novel retraining function is designed to further improve classification accuracy. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world datasets from two sources with significantly different characteristics—a US university campus that relies on state-of-the-art power monitoring and uses mostly non-renewable energy sources, and a rural village in Tanzania that relies on wireless monitoring and uses 100% solar energy. In comparison with traditional AI approaches, it achieves consistently higher accuracy and runtime efficiency on both datasets and under a wide variety of evaluation metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first investigation of HDC for anomaly detection in smart grids. Our results show that HDC-based methods have considerable potential for accurate real-time detection of load anomalies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Anomaly detection; Artificial intelligence; Data imbalance; Hyperdimensional computing; Smart grid; Tanzania; Artificial intelligence; Associative processing; Classification (of information); Electric power transmission networks; Signal detection; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Anomaly detection; Classification datasets; Data imbalance; Electrical load; Hyperdimensional computing; Imbalanced classification; Power-distribution system; Pre-processing optimisation; Real-time detection; Smart grid; alternative energy; anomaly; artificial intelligence; monitoring system; real time; smart grid; village; Anomaly detection,Elsevier Ltd,03605442 (ISSN),English,Energy,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: M.

Solving the full optimization models for load shedding is computational burdensome and thus slow react to the intense system variations from the increasing renewable energy sources and the more active demand-side behavior. Other sensitivity-based methods impair the control accuracy and may not guarantee global optimality. Artificial intelligence methods, as the data-driven approaches, have recently been well-recognized for its real-time decision-making capability to tackle the system variations. The existing artificial intelligence methods for emergency load shedding are based on shallow learning algorithms and can lead to both load under-cutting and over-cutting events. However, when the loads are under-cut, the power system will be exposed to a high risk of post-control instability that can propagate into cascading events, which incurs significantly higher cost than an over-cutting event. Being aware of such unbalanced control costs, this paper proposes a risk-averse deep learning method for real-time emergency load shedding, which trains deep neural network towards the reluctance to load under-cutting events, so as to avoid the huge control cost incurred by control failure. The case studies on two renewable power systems demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed risk-averse method can significantly improve the control success rate with negligible increase in prediction error, ending up with lower overall control cost. The results verify the enhanced control performance and the practical values of the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Deep learning; Emergency load shedding; Extended equal-area criterion; Power system stability; Renewable energy; Risk-averse learning; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Electric power plant loads; Electric power system control; Electric power system stability; Learning algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Transients; Control costs; Deep learning; Emergency load shedding; Extended equal area criterion; Load-shedding; Power systems stability; Real- time; Renewable energies; Risk averse; Risk-averse learning; alternative energy; artificial intelligence; instability; machine learning; optimization; risk factor; Electric load shedding,Elsevier Ltd,03062619 (ISSN),English,Appl.

Accordingly, using a conventional numerical method with only a physics-based model for complete optimization is impractical. To resolve this problem, this paper adopted an optimization method of using an artificial intelligence scheme that combines an artificial neural network (ANN) and a genetic algorithm (GA). Especially, the ANN was constructed based on results from a physics-based model to obtain a large amount of accurate simulation data in a short time frame. A distributed generation (DG) system based on a gas turbine (GT) and renewable energy (RE) was simulated to demonstrate the usefulness of the optimization method. In consideration of the capacity and partial load performance of the GT, the optimization of the sizing and operation strategy of the DG system was performed for three system design scenarios. The optimization criteria were cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness. The method reduced the calculation time by more than three orders of magnitude while maintaining the same accuracy as the physics-based model. The approach and methodology are expected to be applicable to accurate and fast optimization of various sophisticated energy systems. © 2021 by the authors.

This increase leads to a decrease in the total inertia of the microgrids, which affects microgrid stability. Moreover, voltage and frequency control in low-inertia microgrids is more difficult and sensitive. Objective: Improve low inertia isolated microgrids' dynamic response and save the microgrid stability at different contingency and uncertainty conditions. Moreover, it allows for more penetration of renewable energy sources. Methods: Proposing different control strategies based on virtual inertia control. The first is a propor-tional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and then, to allow for more tuning flexibility, a fraction-al-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller is used. MATLAB™/Simulink is used to compare the response of the isolated microgrid without virtual inertia control, with conventional virtual inertia control, PID-based virtual inertia control, and FOPID-based virtual inertia control. The PID and FOPID controllers’ parameters are tuned using the ant colony optimization (ACO) technique. Results: The proposed control techniques save the isolated microgrids' stability at different penetration levels of renewable energy sources and operating conditions. At the same time, the isolated mi-crogrid without virtual inertia control or conventional virtual inertia control can not save its stability in many operating conditions. Conclusion: The proposed fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID)-based virtual inertia control has proven its effectiveness in saving the isolated microgrid stability and gives the best controller response. FOPID-based virtual inertia control minimizes the frequency deviation with different disturbances and operating conditions. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.",Ant colony; FOPID; frequency stability; microgrid; PID; virtual inertial control; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Controllers; Electric control equipment; Microgrids; Natural resources; Proportional control systems; Renewable energy resources; Stability; Two term control systems; Ant colonies; Fraction-al-order proportional-integral-derivative; Inertial controls; Microgrid; Microgrid stability; Operating condition; Propor-tional-integral-derivative; Proportional integral derivatives; Renewable energy source; Virtual inertial control; Three term control systems,Bentham Science Publishers,23520965 (ISSN),English,Recent Adv.

A Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) is beneficial for meeting load demands, but optimal sizing is the main problem in the process of obtaining a cost-efficient system based on certain load demands and techno-economic parameters. In this article, the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm was used for the optimal sizing of components and compared to other methods. The HRESs consisted of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine, battery, diesel generator and inverter components. A powerful rule-based energy management scheme was introduced to manage the power flow between system parts which constitute the microgrid that will minimize the annual system cost and reliably meet the energy demand. The decision variables for this optimization were the PV panel power, wind power, and the number of batteries. Simulation results revealed that HS provided the optimum sizing among the other methods including HOMER, Ant Colony Optimizer and Jaya. The time performances of the algorithms were also examined, and the HS algorithm had better performance and convergence properties.

In addition, the transportation sector radiates a considerable amount of toxic gases in the form of SO2 and CO2. The national grid must supply a huge amount of electricity on a regular basis to meet the increasing power demands of EVs. This study thoroughly investigates the technical and economic benefits of an off-grid and grid-connected hybrid energy system with various configurations of a solar, wind turbine and battery energy storage system for the electric vehicle charging load in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. The goal is to decrease the cost of energy while reducing the chance of power outages in the system. This is achieved by using a new optimization algorithm called the modified salp swarm optimization algorithm (MSSOA), which is based on an evolutionary algorithm approach. MSSOA is an improved version of SSOA, which addresses its shortcomings. It has two search strategies to enhance its efficiency: first, it uses Levy flight distribution (LFD) to help individuals reach new positions faster, and second, it instructs individuals to spiral around the optimal solution, improving the exploitation phase. The MSSOA’s effectiveness is confirmed by comparing its results with those of the conventional salp swarm optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO). According to simulation findings, MSSOA has excellent accuracy and robustness. In this region, the SPV/WT/BESS-based EV charging station is the optimal option for EV charging stations. The SPV/WT/BESS design has the lowest LCOE of all feasible configurations in the region under study. The optimum values for the LCOE and TNPC using MSSOA are USD 0.3697/kWh and USD 99,928.34, which are much lower than the optimized values for the LCOE (USD 0.4156) and TNPC (USD 1,12,671.75) using SSOA. Furthermore, a comprehensive techno–economic analysis of optimized hybrid systems is assessed by incorporating the grid-connected option. The grid connected system results in optimized values of the LCOE (USD 0.0732/kWh) and TNPC (USD 1,541,076). The impact of different grid purchase prices on the levelized cost of energy is also studied. Our results will assist the researchers to determine the best technique for the optimization of an optimal energy system. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; electric vehicles; energy storage system; evolutionary algorithm; optimization algorithm; renewable energy; solar photovoltaic; wind turbine,MDPI,22277390 (ISSN),English,Mathematics,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: I.

When solar energy is effectively utilized during the day, the environment is not only more comfortable for users, but it also utilizes energy more efficiently for both heating and cooling purposes. Because of this, increasing the building’s energy efficiency requires first controlling the amount of light that enters the space. Considering that the only parts of the building that come into direct contact with the sun are the windows, it is essential to make use of louvers in order to regulate the amount of sunlight that enters the building. Through the use of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), the purpose of this study is to estimate the proportions and technical specifications of external louvers, as well as to propose a model for designing the southern openings of educational space in order to maximize energy efficiency and intelligent consumption, as well as to ensure that the appropriate amount of light is provided. According to the findings of this research, the design of external louvers is heavily influenced by a total of five distinct aspects: the number of louvers, the depth of the louvers, the angle of rotation of the louvers, the distance between the louvers and the window, and the reflection coefficient of the louvers. The results of the 2067 simulated case study show that the best reflection rates of the louvers are between 0 and 15 percent, and the most optimal distance between the louvers and the window is in the range of 0 to 18 centimeters.

A new type of sharing economy is emerging with the sharing of energy resources to reduce transaction costs by using platform services in the cloud. Given the obstacles posed by the legacy system and various forms of renewable energy integration, Distributed Energy and Micro Grids (DE-MG) are an efficient means of raising the quality of energy services. Rules for microgrid scalability, maintaining a budget, and security can make this difficult.

The widespread adoption of emerging technologies and the increased reliance on renewable sources of energy have created a need for a robust and accurate system for energy forecasting. This demand is becoming increasingly relevant due to the ongoing 2022 energy crisis. Modern power systems are very complex with many complicated correlations between various forecasting factors and parameters. Furthermore, renewable energy is often dependent on weather conditions, which complicates the process of forecasting. This work presents a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven energy forecasting tuned deep learning framework. By formatting predictors as a time series, two variations of recurrent neural networks (RNN)s have been implemented: long-short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks. However, both approaches present several hyperparameters that require adequate tuning to attain desirable performance. Therefore, this work also proposes an improved version of a well know swarm intelligence algorithm, the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), tasked with tackling hyperparameter tuning for both approaches. To demonstrate the improvements made, three datasets have been constructed for evaluation from publicly available real-world data that contain relevant solar, wind, and power-grid load parameters alongside weather data. The proposed metaheuristic algorithm has been subjected to a comparative analysis with several contemporary metaheuristic algorithms to showcase the improvements made. The introduced metaheuristic demonstrated the best performance with a mean square error (MSE) rate for solar generation of only 0.0132 with LSTM methods and 0.0134 with GRU. Similar performance was observed for wind power generation forecasting with a MSE of 0.00292 with LSTM and 0.00287. When tackling power grid load forecasting a median MSE of 0.0162 was attained with LSTM and 0.01504 with GRU. Therefore there is great potential for tackling these tasks using the proposed approach. The best-performing models have been analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to determine the factors that have the highest influence on energy generation and demand. © 2023 The Author(s)",Energy forecasting; Metaheuristic optimization; Multivariate time series; Renewable energy; Swarm intelligence; Brain; Energy policy; Mean square error; Meteorology; Power generation; Solar power generation; Swarm intelligence; Time series; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Energy forecasting; Hyper-parameter; Means square errors; Metaheuristic; Metaheuristic optimization; Multivariate time series; Neural-networks; Performance; Power grids; Renewable energies; Long short-term memory,Elsevier Inc.,00200255 (ISSN),English,Inf Sci,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 50; Correspondence Address: M.

The efficiency of Electric Vehicles (EVs) are highly depends on the precise measurement of significant factors, as well as on the appropriate operation and analysis of the battery storage system. Unfortunately, inadequate battery storage system monitoring and safety measures can result in serious problems such battery over-charging, over-discharging, overloading, imbalanced cells, heat explosion, and combustion hazards. The quantity of a battery’s energy in respect to its capability is described to as the state of charge (SOC). SOC is measured in percentage points and is estimated as the distance between the battery’s maximum possible output and its average energy at a specific time under the same issues. State of health (SOH) is the evaluation of a battery’s maximum charge amount compared to its starting value when it is first discharged. SOH is calculated using percentage points as its variables. An efficient battery management system, which includes tailored to the content, charging-discharging control, thermal regulation, battery protection and security, is essential for addressing these issues. This paper’s objective is to provide a thorough analysis of various intelligent control strategies and battery management system methodologies used in the EV applications. Also, the review assesses the smart algorithms for estimating battery state in terms of their attributes, customization, arrangement, accuracy, benefits, and drawbacks.

Several actions are being taken to reduce the GHG emissions from maritime vessels, and integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is one of them. Ocean-going marine ships need a large amount of reliable energy to support the propulsive load. Intermittency is one of the drawbacks of RESs, and penetration of RESs in maritime vessels is limited by the cargo carrying capacity and usable area of that ship. Other types of reliable energy sources need to be incorporated in ships to overcome these shortcomings of RESs. Some researchers proposed to integrate fossil fuel-based generators like diesel generators and renewable energy in marine vessels to reduce GHG emissions. As the penetration of RESs in marine ships is limited, fossil fuel-based generators provide most of the en-ergy. Therefore, renewable and fossil fuel-based hybrid energy systems in maritime vessels can not reduce GHG emissions to the desired level. Fossil fuel-based generators need to be replaced by emissions-free energy sources to make marine ships free from emissions. Nuclear energy is emis-sions-free energy, and small-scale nuclear reactors like Microreactors (MRs) are competent to re-place fossil fuel-based generators. In this paper, the technical, environmental, and economic competitiveness of Nuclear-Renewable Hybrid Energy Systems (N-R HES) in marine ships are assessed. The lifecycle cost of MR, reliability of the proposed system, and limitations of integrating renewable energy in maritime vessels are considered in this study. The proposed N-R HES is compared with three different energy systems, namely ‘Standalone Fossil Fuel-based Energy Systems’, ‘Renewable and Fossil Fuel-based Hybrid Energy Systems’, and ‘Standalone Nuclear Energy System’. The cost modeling of each energy system is carried out in MATLAB simulator. Each energy system is optimized by using the Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA), an artificial intelligence algorithm, to find out the optimal configuration of the system components in terms of Net Present Cost (NPC). The results determine that N-R HES has the lowest NPC compared to the other three energy sys-tems. The performance of the DE algorithm is compared with another widely accepted artificial intelligence optimization technique called ‘Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)’ to validate the findings of the DE algorithm. The impact of control parameters in the DE algorithm is assessed by em-ploying the Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE) algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the impact of different system parameters on this study’s findings. © 2021 by the authors.

An ESS is characterized by rapid control, free charging, and discharg-ing. Because of these characteristics, it can efficiently respond to sudden events that affect the power system and can help to resolve congested lines caused by the excessive output of distributed generators (DGs) using renewable energy sources (RESs). In order to efficiently and economically install new ESSs in the power system, the following two factors must be considered: the optimal installation placements and the optimal sizes of ESSs. Many studies have explored the optimal installation placement and the sizing of ESSs by using analytical approaches, mathematical optimization tech-niques, and artificial intelligence. This paper presents an algorithm to determine the optimal installation placement and sizing of ESSs for a virtual multi‐slack (VMS) operation based on a power sensitivity analysis in a stand‐alone microgrid. Through the proposed algorithm, the optimal installation placement can be determined by a simple calculation based on a power sensitivity matrix, and the optimal sizing of the ESS for the determined placement can be obtained at the same time. The algorithm is verified through several case studies in a stand‐alone microgrid based on practical power system data. The results of the proposed algorithm show that installing ESSs in the optimal placement could improve the voltage stability of the microgrid. The sizing of the newly installed ESS was also properly determined. © 2021 by the authors.

However, both academia and industry are still constantly facing challenges in the aspects of cost reduction, monitoring, safety and sustainability improvement for the design and maintenance of FOWTs. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate an engineering application of a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based method, named SADA, on the full-scale measurement data of an Hywind FOWT. The SADA method was applied to perform numerical optimization and dynamic responses prediction of the FOWTs, based on the full-scale data from one Hywind FOWT in Scotland. The methodology of SADA and the key technology of the application are introduced firstly. Then, the selection of Key Discipline Parameters (KDPs) is introduced, followed with the training of AI-based numerical models with full-scale measurement data, including Floater motions, wind, wave and current data. After that, the numerical model imbedded in SADA is trained to be intelligent for the objective Hywind FOWT under different sea states. The intelligent SADA model is used to do comparisons and predictions. The comparison results show that using SADA method, the AI-trained numerical model can predict the motions of Hywind supporting Floater in higher accuracy. In addition, other physical quantities that cannot be obtained directly in full-scale measurement easily but are of great concern by industry, can also be obtained from a more believable perspective.

Furthermore, the transport industry emits greenhouse gases, particularly SO2, CO2. The national grid has to supply an enormous amount of power on a daily basis due to the surplus power required to charge these electric vehicles. This paper presents the various hybrid energy system configurations to meet the power requirements of the electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) situated in the northwest region of Delhi, India. The three configurations are: (a) solar photovoltaic/diesel generator/battery-based EVCS, (b) solar photovoltaic/battery-based EVCS, and (c) grid-and-solar photovoltaic-based EVCS. The meta-heuristic techniques are implemented to analyze the technological, financial, and environmental feasibility of the three possible configurations. The optimization algorithm intends to reduce the total net present cost and levelized cost of energy while keeping the value of lack of power supply probability within limits. To confirm the solution quality obtained using modified salp swarm algorithm (MSSA), the popularly used HOMER software, salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and the gray wolf optimization are applied to the same problem, and their outcomes are equated to those attained by the MSSA. MSSA exhibits superior accuracy and robustness based on simulation outcomes. The MSSA performs much better in terms of computation time followed by the SSA and gray wolf optimization. MSSA results in reduced levelized cost of energy values in all three configurations, i.e., USD 0.482/kWh, USD 0.684/kWh, and USD 0.119/kWh in configurations 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Besides achieving minimum cost, modern generation schedules must satisfy a larger set of different complex constraints. These account for the generation constraints in the presence of renewable generation, network constraints affected by the distributed energy resources, bilateral contracts enclosing independent capacity provision, ancillary power auctions, net-metering and feed-in-tariff prosumers, and corrective security actions in sudden load variations or outage circumstances. In this work, a new method is presented to appropriately enhance the integration of distributed energy resources in low-inertia power grids. Based on optimal unit commitment schedules derived from priority-based dynamic programming, the potential of increasing the renewable capacity was examined, performing simulations for different scenarios. To ameliorate the expensive requirement of computational complexity, this approach aimed at eliminating the increased exploration-exploitation efforts. On the contrary, its promising solution relies on the evolutionary commitment of the next optimum configuration based on priority-list schemes to accommodate the intermittent generation progressively. This is achieved via the collection of mappings that transform many-valued clausal forms into satisfiability equivalent Boolean expressions. © 2021 by the authors.",artificial intelligence models; Boolean mapping; global optimization; neural networks; unit commitment,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),26734117 (ISSN),English,Eng.,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: P.

The application of renewable energy sources (RES) and unit commitment (UC) is the basic idea of this concept. Therefore, a new approach to solving the UC problem is introduced. The proposed method has a simple procedure to obtain the popular solutions in an acceptable time interval, by creating a basic model of the schedule of the state of energy units RES. It is obvious that individual consumer units, of an operational nature, take hourly performance values by performing economic evaluations on them in the sense of cost optimization. This is conducted through an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm by optimizing the dedicated cost function, simulated by annealing. Despite the acceptable solution obtained from these two steps, another shift is proposed, called the TDD process in a given consumer area. This process in the application of AI in the system of selection of universal load TDD from hundreds of possible ones is based on the use of artificial neural networks and cluster analysis, which is represented by the application of the Kohonen map. This logical process to achieve a modified solution is a self-organizing map (SOM). It is a software tool for visualizing high-dimensional data. Converts complex, nonlinear statistical relationships (functions) between high-dimensional data to simple geometric relationships, low-dimensional representation. The output of SOM is an optimized load TDD on the basis of which the process of automatic control of UC in the local urban area is built. The results of the AI application in the case of sustainable energy solutions confirm that this UC method provides a robust solution to an almost optimal solution. © 2022 by the author.

Solar parabolic dish collector (SPDC) is an effective alternative to fossil fuels due to its high efficiency. Nevertheless, performance prediction, optimization, and working fluid selection of SPDCs are highly complex problems and need complicated calculations and/or costly time-consuming experiments. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms have been proven to be beneficial in modeling different solar systems. Therefore, this study proposes an improved method to predict the thermal performance parameters of SPDC with a cylindrical cavity receiver using a modified algorithm of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) integrated with equilibrium optimizer (EO). In the developed algorithm, EO is employed as a new metaheuristic approach to enhance the prediction accuracy of ANFIS via determining the optimal values of ANFIS parameters. To evaluate the performance of the developed method, ANFIS-EO is compared with ANFIS and the conventional artificial neural network. The three models were applied to compare and predict the temperature difference of working fluid, heat gain, and energy efficiency of cylindrical receiver for SPDC operating with two different solar working fluids, namely, multi-wall carbon nanotubes/thermal oil nanofluid and pure thermal oil. Moreover, five statistical criteria are utilized to evaluate the performance of the investigated algorithms. The statistical performance results showed that the ANFIS-EO technique had the best prediction accuracy among the three models, and can be regarded as a powerful optimization tool for predicting the energetic performance of SPDC. The predicted results obtained by the ANFIS-EO have an excellent determination coefficient of 0.99999 for all predicted responses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Cylindrical receiver; Energetic performance comparison; Equilibrium optimizer; Multi-wall carbon nanotube /oil nanofluid; Solar dish collector; Energy efficiency; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Optimization; Parameter estimation; Solar energy; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Cylindrical receiver; Energetic performance comparison; Equilibrium optimizer; Multi-wall carbon nanotube /oil nanofluid; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Optimizers; Performance; Solar dish collector; Solar parabolic dish collector; algorithm; energy efficiency; exploitation; instrument platform; instrumentation; integrated approach; optimization; performance assessment; sustainability; Nanofluidics,Elsevier Ltd,03605442 (ISSN),English,Energy,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 54; Correspondence Address: J.

Coal, natural gas, and petroleum are examples of fossil fuels that are not replenished and are thus non-renewable energy sources due to their high carbon content and the methods by which they are generated. To predict energy production of renewable sources, researchers use energy forecasting techniques based on the recent advances in machine learning approaches. Numerous prediction methods have significant drawbacks, including high computational complexity and inability to generalize for various types of sources of renewable energy sources. Methodology: In this paper, we proposed a novel approach capable of generalizing the prediction accuracy for both wind speed and solar radiation forecasting data. The proposed approach is based on a new optimization algorithm and a new stacked ensemble model. The new optimization algorithm is a hybrid of Al-Biruni Earth Radius (BER) and genetic algorithm (GA) and it is denoted by the GABER optimization algorithm. This algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the proposed stacked ensemble model to boost the prediction accuracy and to improve the generalization capability. Results: To evaluate the proposed approach, several experiments are conducted to study its effectiveness and superiority compared to other optimization methods and forecasting models. In addition, statistical tests are conducted to assess the significance and difference of the proposed approach.

The EMS is regarded as a strong enabler of providing the optimized scheduling control in operation and management of usage of disperse DERs and Renewable Energy reSources (RES) such as a small-size wind-turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) energies. The main objective to be pursued by the EMS is the minimization of the overall operating cost of the MG integrated VPP network. However, the minimization of the power peaks is a new objective and open issue to a well-functional EMS, along with the maximization of profit in the energy market. Thus, both objectives have to be taken into account at the same time. Thus, this paper proposes the EMS application incorporating power offering strategy applying a nature-inspired algorithm such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, in order to find the optimal solution of the objective function in the context of the overall operating cost, the coordination of DERs, and the energy losses in a MG integrated VPP network. For a fair DERs coordination with minimized power fluctuations in the power flow, the power offering strategies with an active power control and re-distribution are proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed MG integrated VPP model with PSO-based EMS employing Egalitarian reDistribution (ED) power offering strategy is most feasible option for the overall operating cost of VPP revenue. The total operating cost of the proposed EMS with ED strategy is 40.98$ compared to 432.8$ of MGs only without EMS. It is concluded that each MGs in the proposed VPP model intelligently participates in energy trading market compliant with the objective function, to minimize the overall cost and the power fluctuation. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

So, the supply power quality issue still remains a major challenge as its degradation can cause huge destabilization of electrical networks. As renewable energy sources have irregular nature, a microgrid essentially needs an energy storage system containing advanced power electronic converters, which is the root cause of the majority of power quality disturbances. Also, the integration of non-linear and unbalanced loads into the grid adds to its power quality problems.

The emergence of 6G, IoT (Internet of Things), smart technologies and AI (artificial intelligence) has made it possible to integrate renewable energy solutions to save energy and to preserve green environments by saving energy generation resources. The data are generated from diverse nodes and geographical locations in large amounts, and it is very challenging to manage the transition states of data. Optical fibers and optical channels play an important role in handling the flow of massive data. Innovative solutions are required to handle the transition of data by saving energy optimally. Energy is life, and saving energy is as important as saving life. All the newer technologies are thriving for minimal consumption of energy by exploiting smart solutions and with the advent of renewable solutions for energy generation. In many application scenarios, data must be transmitted to a sink/server within a short span of time as soon as the event takes place. An inter-hop minimal latency is required when data are transferred between hops in a green multi-hop cognitive radio network (GM-CRN), which requires innovative solutions to transmit the data over optical channels by consuming minimal energy. This article focuses on the integration of renewable energy resources in multi-hop optical channels, which not only helps save energy but also optimizes the data transmission rate, throughput and transmission latency. The management of renewable energy generation resources along with inter-hop delay is still a challenging task and this article attempts to provide a solution to address this problem. This paper suggests a mechanism that ensures minimal inter-hop delay and interference avoidance to optimize network utility. The sink allocates licensed channels to the IoT devices with energy harvesting (EH) capability for data transmission by considering the network utility, energy harvesting, and sustainability of energy. The research in this article further investigates a utility optimization and minimal delay problem, which can be decomposed into four deterministic sub-problems, i.e., the device battery management (DBM) problem, data discard control (DDC) problem, sampling rate control (SRC) problem, and interference-free channel allocation (ICA) problem with the aid of Lyapunov Optimization techniques. Finally, an efficient online algorithm is also devised to optimize the network utility by minimal allocation of power to sink nodes without hampering the data transmission speed on optical channels. The results of the proposed mechanism are evaluated by using the standard statistical parameters in a simulated environment, and the proposed mechanism is compared with state-of-the-art techniques to assess the viability of the proposed approach for advanced optical technologies (AOT). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Advanced optical systems; Advanced optical technologies (AOT); Energy harvesting; Internet of things; Multi-hop; Cognitive radio; Data communication systems; Data transfer; Information management; Internet of things; Optical fibers; Optical systems; Renewable energy resources; Advanced optical system; Advanced optical technology; Energy; Energy generations; Generation resources; Multi-hops; Network utility; Optical channels; Optical technology; Saving energy; Energy harvesting,Springer,03068919 (ISSN),English,Opt Quantum Electron,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: M.

Besides efficient utilization of the steel mill gases for power and heat supply, deploying technologies of carbon capture, utilization and renewable power is in urgent need for the transition of the steel industry towards carbon neutrality. To attain this goal, this paper develops a low-carbon steel mill gas utilization system with the integration of solvent-based carbon capture, methanol production based carbon utilization and renewable power. An artificial intelligent based optimal scheduling is then proposed to coordinate the interactions among gas, heat, electricity and carbon under variant weather and load conditions. Gradient boosted regression trees with Bayesian optimization is exploited to identify efficient surrogate models for the complex devices within the system. Heuristic search algorithm of particle swarm optimization is applied to find the low-carbon and economical scheduling within the entire scheduling period. Case studies show that the optimal scheduling can unlock complementary advantages among renewable energy, carbon capture and utilization, leading to 97% renewable energy curtailment reduction, 62% CO2 emission reduction and 126 tons of methanol production in 24 h.

Fuzzy logic (FL) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) is implemented to achieve the optimal performance of seawater desalination plants (SWDP) within the minimum feed-in tariff (FiT). The technical difficulties involved in the variation of energy price from one time to another and the system parameters uncertainties. For example, the price of energy is higher at the peak time and the price is lower at normal times. Also, the peak time can change from one day to another day. The proposed management system can deal with these variations and uncertainty cases. The suggested EMS is achieved through a bidirectional electrical energy interchange approach ( pi -EEIA). The main concept behind the proposed pi -EEIA is how and when to inject the excess generated energy of renewable energy into the utility grid or charge the battery depending on the minimum dynamic cost criterion and vice versa. To accomplish this study a 700 m3/day SWDP located in Egypt fed on solar energy and a utility network has been constructed and analyzed. The system includes SWDP fed from a photovoltaic (PV) array as well as the utility grid in addition to a battery energy storage system (BESS). The main objective of this study is the management and coordination between the energy exchange process from the solar energy, the utility network, and BESS to provide sufficient electrical energy for SWDP within the minimum FiT. The system is constructed and validated using the MATLAB/SIMULINK™ software package. The proposed FL and HHO-based EMSs are investigated in the presence of the system uncertainties such as the change in the energy (excess or shortage) as well as the change in the energy price in the utility network (high or low) with (normal or peak) time. The attained results demonstrate that the proposed FL and HHO-based EMSs provide high dynamic performance and accurate coordination between various energy resources and BESS. The results show that FL-based EMS achieves a profit of 10.28 but the HHO-based EMS achieves a profit of 10.11 in the same period.  © 2013 IEEE.",Hybrid system; management control system; power cost signal; PV~system; seawater desalination plants; Computer circuits; Cost functions; Costs; Desalination; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Fuzzy logic; MATLAB; Secondary batteries; Solar energy; Battery; Energy; Fuzzy-Logic; Management control system; Microgrid; Optimisations; Photovoltaic systems; Power cost signal; Power costs; Seawater desalination plants; Hybrid systems,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536 (ISSN),English,IEEE Access,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 33; Correspondence Address: C.-L.

Accurate and reliable wind speed prediction is crucial for the effective exploitation of wind energy. However, previous studies have generally ignored the importance of capturing both linear and non-linear wind speed characteristics and selecting forecasting sub-models objectively, resulting in poor forecasting performance. To bridge these gaps, a novel ensemble forecasting system is proposed by integrating the decomposition strategy, sub-model selection, and ensemble point and interval prediction based on the newly proposed multi-objective Archimedes optimization algorithm, which has been demonstrated to be effective at the theoretical and empirical levels for providing reliable wind speed forecasting results. Based on hourly-resolution wind speed data from three datasets of Shandong Peninsula, China, three experiments and discussions are conducted. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of obtaining a high degree of precision and reliability for both point and interval forecasting relative to other comparative models.

Solar energy is the most effective source of renewable energy technologies. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) system have become common in grid-linked applications and plays a vital part in power production. MPPT algorithms enable PV systems to capture the maximum available power from the solar panels, regardless of variations in solar irradiance, temperature, and other environmental factors. By continuously tracking the MPP, MPPT techniques ensure that the PV system operates at its highest efficiency, resulting in increased energy harvesting and improved overall performance. Meanwhile, the frequent modifications in irradiance and temperature pose a major challenging issue which can be resolved by the use of artificial intelligence MPPT methodologies like artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and metaheuristics systems. In this aspect, this work presents a new quasi-oppositional artificial algae optimization (QOAAO) with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique, named QOAAO-ANFIS for maximum efficiency MPPT technique for minimizing the present ripple and power oscillations over the MPP. The presented QOAAO-ANFIS model mainly depends upon the integration of the ANFIS and QOHOA techniques. In addition, the presented QOAAO-ANFIS model involves optimal MF selection of the ANFIS model to estimate the irradiation level and compute PV voltage equivalent to maximal power point. The QOAAO model can be utilized for enhancing the optimization process of membership function variables under varying conditions and awareness of global optima.

This paper aims to improve the performance of power systems by minimizing two distinct objective functions namely active power loss in the transmission network and total voltage deviation at the load buses subjected to various constraints within multiobjective framework. The proposed AHA-based framework maps the inherent flight and foraging capabilities exhibited by hummingbirds in nature to determine the best settings for the control variables (i.e., voltages at generation buses, the tap positions of on-load tap-changing transformers (OLTCs) and the size of switchable shunt VAR compensators) to minimize the overall objective functions. A multiobjective optimal reactive power dispatch framework (MO-ORPD) considering renewable energy sources (RES) and load uncertainties is also proposed to minimize the individual objectives simultaneously.

Meanwhile, the hydrogen energy storage system (HySS) is utilized as energy storage. Firstly, by reducing the levelized cost of energy (COE), this study presents the optimal size and configuration of various renewable and distributed energy resources in HMG systems. Secondly, two novel modified hybridized particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) are developed, namely, ACO initialized PSO and ACO updated PSO. The optimal simulation results using PSO and ACO metaheuristic technique either individually or hybridized are compared in terms of primarily minimizing the levelized COE and achieving short execution time. Thirdly, to verify the geographical-independency of the integration of HySS for producing onsite green hydrogen locally, the estimation performance is examined for three different locations in Egypt, Mozambique and Denmark respectively using hourly meteorological and load data in 2019. Sensitivity and effectiveness analysis are carried out to highlight the major parameters that impact HySS incorporation. Finally, the system readiness level together with the different hydrogen, economy barriers constraints, limitations and risks are investigated based on the technology readiness level and the integration readiness level indices. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the ACO updated PSO optimization algorithm towards minimizing the levelized COE in the different regions.

However, most of these sources could perhaps not easily replace conventional power plants due to the fact that they have nonlinear characteristics, and most of these issues still need to be resolved. In order to effectively manage the non-linearity of some RE sources and improve the energy harvesting capability of these systems, various methods have been adopted. Some of these techniques have one or more objective functions and commonly use commercial packages to minimize system cost and improve output power simultaneously. Rural electrification is still pitiably prohibitive, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and off-grid RE technologies remain a reliable way of meeting rural electricity needs. Exploiting these sources could help offset rural electricity demand sustainably while mitigating the negative impacts of using a diesel generator and other sources that are not environmentally friendly.

Also highlighted are the recent trends in hybrid system optimization with RE technologies and the various considerations scholars use in hybrid applications.

In rural areas, RSUs are powered by renewable energy sources like solar energy. Hence, the request fulfillment of vehicles must be done in such a way that the energy consumption across RSUs is minimized. The requests are categorized into traditional application (low computation) requests and smart application (high computation) requests. To avoid excessive computation at RSUs, low computation requests are scheduled across RSUs while high computation requests are scheduled across fog servers for processing. In this paper, we propose an online energy-efficient Inter-RSU Scheduling Algorithm (ee-IRSA) and a distributed Ant Colony Optimization-based Load balancing technique (d-ACOL) for optimizing the request fulfillment of traditional and smart application requests, respectively. ee-IRSA ensures minimum and uniform energy consumption across RSUs while d-ACOL ensures minimum queue waiting time of requests across fog servers. In addition, a second-price auction game-based relay vehicle selection technique is proposed which further minimizes the energy consumption of RSUs. Simulation results show that ee-IRSA with relay vehicle selection reduces the energy consumption by 33 % , and d-ACOL reduces the queue waiting time by an average of 48 % as compared to other load balancing techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Ant colony optimization; Load re-balancing; Relay vehicle selection; Second-price auction game; Vehicle-to-roadside communication (V2R); Artificial intelligence; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fog; Roadsides; Scheduling algorithms; Solar energy; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Auction games; Energy-consumption; Load balancing technique; Load re-balancing; Relay vehicle selection; Roadside units; Second-price auction; Second-price auction game; Vehicle-to-roadside communication (V2R); Vehicle-to-roadside communications; Ant colony optimization,Springer,10184864 (ISSN),English,Telecommun.

Having integrated various renewable energy systems (RESs) and a battery storage system (BSS), we proposed an optimization-based demand-side management (DSM) scheduler and energy management controller (SEMC) for a smart home. The suggested SEMC creates a DSM-based operational plan regarding user-centered and comfort-aware preferences. Using the generated appliances operation plan, consumers can reduce energy costs, carbon emissions, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), improve their comfort in terms of thermal, illumination, and appliances usage preferences. A schedule for residential consumers is suggested using ant colony optimization (ACO), teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), Jaya algorithm, rainfall algorithm, firefly algorithm, and our hybrid ACO and TLBO optimization (ACTLBO) algorithm. Five existing algorithms-based frameworks validate the DSM framework that relies on ACTLBO. The results validate that the integration of RESs and BSS, and adapting our proposed algorithm and SEMC under demand response program real-time price reduced the energy bill costs, PAR and CO2 in Case I: only external grid (EG) usage by 42.14%, 22.05%, and 28.33%, in Case II: EG with RESs by 21.79%, 11.27%, 17.02%, and in Case III: EG with RESs and BSS by 28.76%, 41.53%, 21.86%, respectively as compared to without employing SEMC. Moreover, the user-comfort (UC) improvement index-ratio with scheduling using ACTLBO is 7.77%, 24.73%, 5.00%, and 3.43% in aspects of indoor air quality, average delay, thermal, and visual, respectively.

The development of a sustainable and cost-effective method for producing green hydrogen has gained a lot of attention. Water electrolysis is the best and most environmentally friendly method for producing green hydrogen-based renewable energy. Therefore, identifying the ideal operating parameters of the water electrolysis process is critical to hydrogen production. Three controlling factors must be appropriately identified to boost hydrogen generation, namely electrolysis time (min), electric voltage (V), and catalyst amount (μg). The proposed methodology contains the following two phases: modeling and optimization. Initially, a robust model of the water electrolysis process in terms of controlling factors was established using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based on the experimental dataset. After that, a modern pelican optimization algorithm (POA) was employed to identify the ideal parameters of electrolysis duration, electric voltage, and catalyst amount to enhance hydrogen production. Compared to the measured datasets and response surface methodology (RSM), the integration of ANFIS and POA improved the generated hydrogen by around 1.3% and 1.7%, respectively. Overall, this study highlights the potential of ANFIS modeling and optimal parameter identification in optimizing the performance of solar-powered water electrocatalysis systems for green hydrogen production in marine applications. This research could pave the way for the more widespread adoption of this technology in the marine industry, which would help to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint and promote sustainability. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; green hydrogen; marine applications; parameter estimation; water electrocatalysis,MDPI,20771312 (ISSN),English,J.

Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) standout as a promising energy conversion device which can directly convert heat to electricity. Several optimization studies have been carried out on these devices to improve their power generation rate and efficiencies while guaranteeing long lifespan. However, the limitations of finite element methods (FEMs) in easily providing optimization guidelines at a fast rate has hindered the manufacture of TEGs with high thermo-mechanical performance. This is why this paper presents the first ever artificial intelligence enabled optimization of a TEG conducted via deep neural networks (DNNs). Previous research on this topic completely neglected the mechanical performance and consequently, the service lifetime of the TEG when exposed to thermal operating conditions. To fill this gap, the effects of strategic parameters on the power output, efficiency and thermal stress performances of the TEG are investigated. These parameters are the hot and cold junction temperatures/heat transfer coefficients, incident heat flux, external load resistance, TE leg height, area, and area ratio. The DNN is fed with verified three-dimensional FEM simulations carried out on the ANSYS Workbench platform. The FEM results exhibit almost perfect correlation with experimental data which establishes the precision of the model. Results are that the DNN model is able to provide the necessary optimization guidelines for maximum thermo-mechanical performance in just 8 seconds compared to the 8 hours required by the FEM. The TEGs that were modelled using the DNN optimization guidelines improved the power, efficiency and mechanical performance of the unoptimized TEG by 11.94%, 14.17%, and 91%, respectively. These results are sufficient to provide useful guidelines at a fast rate for the fabrication of high-efficiency TEGs that will operate for a long time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Operation lifespan; Thermo-mechanical optimization; Thermoelectric generator; Electronic equipment; Finite element method; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Heat flux; Heat resistance; Simulation platform; Thermoelectric equipment; Faster rates; Lifespans; Mechanical optimization; Operation lifespan; Optimisations; Thermo-mechanical; Thermo-mechanical optimization; Thermo-mechanical performance; Thermoelectric generators; algorithm; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; correlation; global warming; learning; optimization; power generation; Deep neural networks,Elsevier Ltd,03062619 (ISSN),English,Appl.

In the presence of energy storage in energy hubs, it is possible to efficiently coordinate energy supply and demand while taking advantage of changing energy tariffs and local renewable energy supply sources. In this article, we propose a novel method based on gray wolf optimization (GWO), which breaks down the complex optimization problem into subproblems, including the storage scheduling and another part in the grid, and comes up with the respective solutions via GWO and interior point. As a result, the proposed method avoids the drawbacks of numerical ways and artificial intelligence techniques, which tend to converge only to a local minimum or require heavy computational times. Furthermore, the article proposes a multilayer cloud computing framework for optimally scheduling energy hubs. The present study applies the new technique to a two-hub and three-hub system during 24 h. The approach is also examined in the context of an 11-hub system to investigate the efficiency and potential applications. The outcomes prove that the approach can achieve a very near-global point, which is confirmed through an analytical method, as well as being rapid sufficient to permit for online implementations with receding time horizons.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Cloudâ fog computing (CFC); energy hub (EH); energy sharing; energy storage; gray wolf optimization (GWO); Economics; Electric batteries; Fog; Fog computing; Heat resistance; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Cloud-computing; Cloud-fog computing; Energy hubs; Energy sharings; Gray wolf optimization; Gray wolves; Heat pumps; Index term: energy sharing; Index terms; Optimisations; Resistance-heating; Steady state; Energy storage,IEEE Computer Society,15513203 (ISSN),English,IEEE Trans.

The RE sources are gradually combined with non-renewable energy (NRE) sources into electric grids to satisfy energy demands. Since energy utilization is highly related to national energy policy, energy prediction using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) based models can be employed for energy prediction on RE and NRE power resources. Predicting energy consumption of RE and NRE sources using effective models becomes necessary.With this motivation, this study presents a new multimodal fusionbased predictive tool for energy consumption prediction (MDLFM-ECP) of RE and NRE power sources. Actual data may influence the prediction performance of the results in prediction approaches. The proposed MDLFMECP technique involves pre-processing, fusion-based prediction, and hyperparameter optimization. In addition, the MDLFM-ECP technique involves the fusion of four deep learning (DL) models, namely long short-termmemory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), deep belief network (DBN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Moreover, the chaotic cat swarm optimization (CCSO) algorithm is applied to tune the hyperparameters of the DL models. The design of the CCSO algorithm for optimal hyperparameter tuning of the DL models, showing the novelty of the work.

Marconi 4, Naples, 80125, Italy","Deep neural networks have been regarded as accurate models to predict complex fermentation processes due to their capacity to learn from a high number of data sets via artificial intelligence. To enhance the performance of these models the main challenge is to select the appropriate hyperparameters, such as neural network architecture (number of hidden layers and hidden units), activation function, optimizer, learning rate, and others. This study aims to use a hybrid Bayesian optimization with tree-structured Parzen estimator (BO-TPE) to predict biogas production from real wastewater treatment plant data using deep neural network machine learning (DNN) with optimized hyperparameters. Due to the high number of missing sample measurement records, the data preprocessing process has been performed in three sequential steps: the first step is to remove columns with a high percentage of missing values. The second step concerns removing rows with a high number of missing values. The remaining missing values in the dataset were removed in the third step using the dropna function from Pandas' library. Then, on the remaining data, three normalization techniques (MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, and StandardScaler) were used for 16 relevant features of the anaerobic digestion process (AD) and compared with Non-Normalized data. The RobustScaler technique demonstrated good prediction capabilities of biogas volume produced. The maximum predicted volume was 2236.105 Nm3/d, with the coefficient of determination (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.712, 164.610, and 223.429, respectively. This value remains slightly higher than the actual biogas volume produced in the wastewater treatment plant, which was 2131 Nm3/d. Adopting StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and Non-Normalized data provided statistical performance indicator values of (0.690; 170.518; 231.519), (0.679; 180.575; 235.648), and (0.647; 183.403; 247.203), respectively.

An efficient vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling scheme that can deal with renewable energy volatility and protect vehicle batteries from fast aging is indispensable to enable this benefit. This article develops a novel V2G scheduling method for consuming local renewable energy in microgrids by using a mixed learning framework. It is the first attempt to integrate battery protective targets in GEVs charging management in renewable energy systems. Battery safeguard strategies are derived via an offline soft-run scheduling process, where V2G management is modeled as a constrained optimization problem based on estimated microgrid and GEVs states. Meanwhile, an online V2G regulator is built to facilitate the real-time scheduling of GEVs' charging. The extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is used to train the established online regulator by learning rules from soft-run strategies. The online charging coordination of GEVs is realized by the ELM regulator based on real-time sampled microgrid frequency. The effectiveness of the developed models is verified on a U.K. microgrid with actual energy generation and consumption data.

Wind energy conversion system (WECS) which is the means of harnessing power generation through wind is reportedly one of the most widely installed renewable alternative sources globally. Integrating WECS into the conventional power system grid results in a complex power system grid. Thus, during a disturbance or a fault period on the grid, if proper control measures are not put in place, power system instability due to power system oscillations arises. One such control measure is the damping controller which is coupled to the generating plant through its excitation system. Damping controllers help to dampen power system oscillations, but due to the dynamic nature of the power system and uncertainties inherent in a wind-integrated power grid system, fixed damping controller parameters cannot effectively dampen power system oscillations. Hence, damping controller design becomes an optimization problem.

Several researchers have studied how to clean and minimize dust on PV modules. This paper reviews recent studies on the effects of dust on PV systems and effective cleaning methods. Some locations experience power losses of over 1% each day and 80% monthly efficiency reduction due to dust, which is substantial. This paper delivers a thorough review of the issue of dust on PV modules. It analyzes previous research on how photovoltaic (PV) systems function when exposed to a mix of dust accumulation and other environmental factors. It also delves into the development of models to forecast dust accumulation. Furthermore, it examines various aspects of PV module design, including the frequency of cleaning methods, economic factors, and their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, the study identifies several research gaps that require further exploration.

System inputs are three key parameters that affect performance and commercialization. There is a range of 0.1–0.5 mg/cm2 of Pt, a degree of sulfonation of sulfonated polyether-etherketone varying from 20% to 80%, and a cathode aeration rate of 10–150 mL/min. Based on the model’s accuracies, gradient boost regression was selected for power density prediction and random forest for COD removal prediction. Particle swarm optimization was used as the optimization algorithm after selecting the best models to maximize COD removal and power density. It was found that DS was the most critical parameter for COD removal, and Pt was the most critical parameter for power density. There is a different optimal input value for each model. In order to maximize power density, DS (%) must be 67.7087, Pt (mg/cm2) must be 0.3943, and Aeration (mL/min) must be 117.7192.

This is done by optimally transferring the flexible loads to hours when the per-unit cost of utility is lower. This paper performs a bi-level optimization strategy to lower the operating expense of a low-voltage microgrid (LV MG) system operating in grid-connected mode, comprising battery energy storage (BES), renewable energy sources (RES), and fossil fuel-powered generators. In the first level of optimization, the load model is restructured as per the DSM participation level. Thereafter, the restructured load demand model is considered, and optimal allocation for distributed generators (DGs) is percolated for minimizing the generation cost of the microgrid system in the second level. A recently developed hybrid swarm intelligence algorithm that has already been used in solving diverse power system optimization problems was used as the optimization tool for the study. The generation cost was minimized for different grid participation types and grid pricing strategies with and without consideration of DSM. The numerical results show a 55–75% reduction in generation cost when 20–30% DSM participation was considered.

Aiming at the solutions to improve dynamic frequency response, an innovative controller design is suggested to damp out the stepper variations of frequency and dipper frequency nadir. This work proposes a Virtual synchronous machine (VSM) based on a swarm metaheuristic technique called Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in alleviating the frequency disturbances in multimachine system. ACO tuned VSM offers flexible inertia depending upon the severity that emerged in the system by optimal adjustment of the emulated inertia. In this suggested VSM, the external loop continuously tracks the system disturbances, and accordingly it modifies the controlled output which is further passed to the internal loop. Now, this loop identifies and computes the exact active power required to supply during transients and its computationis assisted by ACO based correction factor which provides optimal inertia constant to improve the dynamic stability of the system. The performance evaluation and comparison has been done on Kundur’s 3-area multimachine system aggregated with 3 areas with 6 synchronous generators and developed in a MATLAB environment which reveals the satisfactory performance of this ACO tuned VSM scheme. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.",Ant colony optimization (ACO); Inverter interfaced distributed generation (IIDG); Renewable energy sources (RES); Virtual inertia; Virtual synchronous machine (VSM); Artificial intelligence; Distributed power generation; Electric inverters; Frequency response; Natural resources; Synchronous machinery; System stability; Virtual Power Plants; Ant colony optimization; Inverte interfaced distributed generation; Inverter interfaced distributed generations; Large-scales; Multimachine systems; Renewable energy source; Synchronous machine; Virtual inertia; Virtual synchronoi machine; Renewable energy resources,Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers,19750102 (ISSN),English,J.

Commercial installations use simple deterministic methods with low economic efficiency. Hence, there is a need for intelligent algorithms that combine technical and economic aspects. Methods based on computational intelligence (CI) could be a solution. The paper presents an algorithm for optimising power flow in microgrids by using computational intelligence methods. This approach ensures technical and economic efficiency by combining multiple aspects in a single objective function with minimal numerical complexity. It is scalable to any industrial or residential microgrid system. The method uses load and generation forecasts at any time horizon and resolution and the actual specifications of the energy storage systems, ensuring that technological constraints are maintained. The paper presents selected calculation results for a typical residential microgrid supplied with a photovoltaic system. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the outcomes provided by a deterministic management system. The computational intelligence method allows the objective function to be adjusted to find the optimal balance of economic and technical effects. Initially, the authors tested the invented algorithm for technical effects, minimising the power exchanged with the distribution system. The application of the algorithm resulted in financial losses, €12.78 for the deterministic algorithm and €8.68 for the algorithm using computational intelligence. Thus, in the next step, a control favouring economic goals was checked using the CI algorithm. The case where charging the storage system from the grid was disabled resulted in a financial benefit of €10.02, whereas when the storage system was allowed to charge from the grid, €437.69. Despite the financial benefits, the application of the algorithm resulted in up to 1560 discharge cycles. Thus, a new unconventional case was considered in which technical and economic objectives were combined, leading to an optimum benefit of €255.17 with 560 discharge cycles per year. Further research of the algorithm will focus on the development of a fitness function coupled to the power system model. © 2023.

For instance, Kenya has 102 MW of grid-tied solar power and 410 MW of grid-tied wind power. However, these sources are very intermittent with low predictability. Thus, after their installation and integration into the grid, they impose a new challenge for the secure, reliable, and economic operation of the system. To mitigate these and to ensure proper planning of the system operations, accurate and faster prediction of the generation output of the wind energy resources and optimal design and sizing of storage for the large-scale wind energy integration into the grid are of paramount importance. Artificial intelligence (AI) and metaheuristic techniques have proven to be efficient and robust in offering solutions to complex nonlinear prediction and optimization problems. Therefore, this study aims to utilize backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm to conduct hourly prediction of the generation output of Lake Turkana Wind Power Plant (LTWPP), a 310 MW plant connected to the Kenyan power grid, and optimally size its battery energy storage system (BESS) using genetic algorithm (GA) to guarantee its dispatchability. The historical weather data, namely wind speed, ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, and generation output from LTWPP, are employed in the training, testing, and validation of the neural network. LTWPP and BESS are modelled in MATLAB R2016a software. Thereafter, the developed BPNN and GA algorithms are applied to the modelled systems to predict the wind output and optimize the storage system, respectively. BESS optimization with neural prediction reduces the BESS capacity and investment costs by 59.82%, while the overall dispatchability of LTWPP is increased from 73.36% to 90.14%, hence enabling the farm to meet its allowable loss of power supply probability (LPSP) index of 0.1 while guaranteeing its dispatchability.  © 2022 Hampfrey Odero et al.",Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Neural networks; Solar energy; Wind power; Backpropagation neural network algorithms; Battery energy storage systems; Case-studies; Dispatchability; Grid-connected; Power grids; Renewable energy source; Resource prediction; Wind energy resources; Wind power plants; Wind,Hindawi Limited,20900147 (ISSN),English,J.

The objective of this article is to minimize the amount of energy consumed from the national energy grid by producer-consumers of energy from renewable sources, in their own smart homes. In order to fulfill this goal, it was necessary to estimate the amount of renewable energy produced on the day-ahead horizon and to schedule the operation of controllable consumers in a smart home. To predict the amount of energy produced, two approaches were used: the first was based on data, and used techniques specific to artificial intelligence, more specifically, multilayer perceptron and radial-basis-function neural networks, and the second was based on models. The accuracy of the short-term prediction horizon of the techniques used was evaluated with quantitative performance indicators so that the most appropriate one in relation to the goal of the article could be selected to be used in the test scenarios. The scheduling of consumer functioning was based on their classification in relation to their ability to be controlled, and on the selection from the peer-reviewed literature of an optimization algorithm which, by load shifting from a smart home, ensured the optimal fulfillment of the objective function. The selected load-shifting algorithm was then integrated into and tested on a real database. The data used were monitored for two representative days, in terms of the amount of energy from renewable energy sources produced and consumed. The load-shifting algorithm proved its effectiveness through the results obtained and which are reported in the article. © 2023 by the authors.",forecasting; load-shifting; power generation; renewable energy sources; scheduling,MDPI,20755309 (ISSN),English,Buildings,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: O.E.

Solar Irradiation Prediction (SIP) is essential to plan, schedule, and manage photovoltaic power plants and grid-based power generation systems. Numerous models have been proposed for SIP in the literature while such studies demand huge volumes of weather data about the target location for a lengthy period of time. In this scenario, commonly availableArtificial Intelligence (AI) technique can be trained over past values of irradiance as well as weatherrelated parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and precipitation. Therefore, in current study, the authors aimed at developing a solar irradiance prediction model by integrating big data analytics with AI models (BDAAI- SIP) using weather forecasting data. In order to perform long-term collection of weather data, Hadoop MapReduce tool is employed. The proposed solar irradiance prediction model operates on different stages. Primarily, data preprocessing take place using various sub processes such as data conversion, missing value replacement, and data normalization. Besides, Elman Neural Network (ENN), a type of feedforward neural network is also applied for predictive analysis. It is divided into input layer, hidden layer, loadbearing layer, and output layer. To overcome the insufficiency of ENN in choosing the value of weights and hidden layer neuron count, Mayfly Optimization (MFO) algorithm is applied. In order to validate the performance of the proposed model, a series of experiments was conducted. The experimental values infer that the proposed model outperformed other methods used for comparison. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

However, as such a new concept, how these local markets will be designed and integrated into existing market structures, and make the most profit from them, is still unclear. In this work, we propose a local market mechanism in which end-users (consumers, small producers, and prosumers) trade energy between peers. Due to possible low liquidity in the local market, the mechanism assumes that end-users fulfill their energy demands through bilateral contracts with an aggregator/retailer with access to the wholesale market. The allowed bids and offers in the local market are bounded by a feed-in tariff and an aggregator tariff guaranteeing that end-users get, at most, the expected cost without considering this market. The problem is modeled as a multi-leader single-follower bi-level optimization problem, in which the upper levels define the maximization of agent profits. In contrast, the lower level maximizes the energy traded in the local market. Due to the complexity of the matter, and lack of perfect information of end-users, we advocate the use of evolutionary computation, a branch of artificial intelligence that has been successfully applied to a wide variety of optimization problems. Throughout three different case studies considering end-users with distinct characteristics, we evaluated the performance of four different algorithms and assessed the benefits that local markets can bring to market participants. Results show that the proposed market mechanism provides overall costs improvements to market players of around 30–40% regarding a baseline where no local market is considered. However, the shift to local markets in energy procurement can affect the conventional retailer/aggregator role. Therefore, innovative business models should be devised for the successful implementation of local markets in the future. © 2021 The Authors",Bi-level optimization; Evolutionary computation; Local electricity markets; Renewable energy; Wholesale market; Evolutionary algorithms; Power markets; Profitability; Bi-level optimization; End-users; Energy; Local electricity market; Local markets; Market integration; Market mechanisms; Optimization problems; Renewable energies; Wholesale markets; Optimization,Elsevier Ltd,01420615 (ISSN),English,Int J Electr Power Energy Syst,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: F.

It is not possible to measure complete PQ data for all possible combinations of dozens of grid-connected appliances, whose load specifics and collisions primarily determine the course of PQ parameters and their eventual disturbances.

Alternatively, they can also negotiate private bilateral contracts. This article addresses the optimization of the retailers purchasing options, to increase their risk-return ratio from electricity markets, and offer more competitive tariffs to consumers. Considering the risk attitude of retailers, they use a multi-step purchasing model composed of a multi-level risk-return optimization and a decision support system. The article presents an agent-based study considering a retailer with a portfolio of 312 real-world consumers. Risk-seeking and risk-neutral retailers obtained a return up to 38%, less than 7% of the optimal return. However, risk-neutral retailers are subject to four times higher risk in their returns than risk-seeking retailers. The results support the conclusion that wholesale markets of electricity are more favourable to risk-seeking retailers, considering their real returns. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Agent-based simulation; Purchasing options of power retailers; Risk attitude; Risk-return optimization; Wholesale markets; Artificial intelligence; Costs; Decision support systems; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Agent based simulation; Market of electricities; Multisteps; Optimisations; Power retailers; Purchasing option of power retailer; Retail market; Risk attitude; Risk-return optimization; Wholesale markets; Sales,Elsevier Ltd,01420615 (ISSN),English,Int J Electr Power Energy Syst,Article,Scopus,Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 15; CODEN: IEPSD,JOUR,108260,,,

With the development of artificial intelligence algorithms and the presence of so many data, the evolution of simulation models has increased. In this research, an improvement to one recent optimization algorithm called the artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) is proposed. An adaptive opposition approach is suggested to select whether or not to use an opposition-based learning (OBL) method. This improvement is developed based on adding an adaptive updating mechanism to enable the original algorithm to obtain more accurate results with more complex problems, and is called the adaptive opposition artificial hummingbird algorithm (AOAHA). The proposed AOAHA was tested on 23 benchmark functions and compared with the original algorithm and other recent optimization algorithms such as supply–demand-based optimization (SDO), wild horse optimizer (WHO), and tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA). The proposed algorithm was applied to obtain accurate models for solar cell systems, which are the basis of solar power plants, in order to increase their efficiency, thus increasing the efficiency of the whole system. The experiments were carried out on two important models—the static and dynamic models—so that the proposed model would be more representative of real systems. Two applications for static models have been proposed: In the first application, the AOAHA satisfies the best root-mean-square values (0.0009825181). In the second application, the performance of the AOAHA is satisfied in all variable irradiance for the system. The results were evaluated in more than one way, taking into account the comparison with other modern and powerful optimization techniques. Improvement showed its potential through its satisfactory results in the tests that were applied to it. © 2022 by the authors.",AHA; AOAHA; Benchmark function; Optimization; Permanent energy; Static and dynamic models,MDPI,20799292 (ISSN),English,Electronics (Switzerland),Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 41; Correspondence Address: E.M.

However, their inherent complexity often makes these simulations computationally prohibitive, despite the current computational power available nowadays. This problem is aggravated when considering renewable energy systems, which are subjected to intermittent weather conditions and must be operated in connection with a grid of variable demand. In that sense, the use of metamodels has shown immense potential in the simulation, analysis, and optimization of energy systems. Therefore, this review presents a comprehensive analysis of the extensive application of metamodeling techniques in energy systems. After conducting a careful search using the Scopus database while targeting a well-defined group of keywords, 474 articles published from 2013 to 2023 were obtained in the present literature review. With a rigorous filtering and screening process, the first pool of articles was reduced to 126. The resulting articles were then separated in two main groups, reviews and research articles. Each of these groups was further organized in terms of the energy system studied, as well as the applicability, machine learning technique and error indicator. The results indicate a steady and significant growth in the number of publications associated with energy systems and different types of metamodeling techniques. The reasons are arguably twofold, reduction of computational time provided by the metamodels and their good accuracy. Nevertheless, and as reported by other studies, the review also identified the need to develop a standardized method for evaluating the error analysis of these models and a comparison between their actual efficiency, which includes accuracy and time. Furthermore, no clear relation was found between specific types of metamodels and specific energy systems. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Artificial intelligence; digital twins; energy system; machine learning; metamodels; renewable energy; thermal science; E-learning; Learning algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Energy systems; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Meta model; Metamodeling; Metamodeling techniques; Optimisations; Physics-based models; Renewable energies; Thermal science; Machine learning,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,10407790 (ISSN),English,Numer Heat Transfer Part B Fundam,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: A.R.

Against this background, technologies for water resource management and treatment have been developed steadily to meet the water demand targets. However, further advances are necessary for securing environmental and economic sustainability. The management of saline water and wastewater is one of the focus areas to tackle the problems of water scarcity and sustainability in the context of water desalination. Hybrid desalination is one of the most practical and efficient technologies that can afford environmental and economic sustainability. Hybridization of multiple processes maximizes the advantages of individual technologies and minimizes their drawbacks. The overall research on desalination and research on hybrid desalination, in particular, increased by a compound annual growth rate of 16.6% and 21.8%, respectively, from 2011 to 2020. Meanwhile, in 2020, 10.7% of scientific articles and reviews dealt with hybrid technologies. Moreover, the advances in hybrid technology are not limited to academic research; they have been widely implemented in the desalination industry. Reverse osmosis–multistage flash (RO-MSF) hybrid technology has been adopted for the largest desalination plant in the world, with a total water production of 1,036,000 m3/d in Ras Al-Khair, Saudi Arabia. The synergetic impacts of hybridization have various benefits depending on the desalination processes selected. In an RO-MSF system, the hybridization leads to additional water production with higher water recovery compared to a standalone RO system. Improvement in energy efficiency is another advantage of hybrid technologies as observed in the case of membrane distillation–adsorp-tion (MD-AD) hybrid system. However, the challenges of hybrid desalination technologies are the complexity of process design, optimization, and operations. In this paper, the case of a forward osmosis–membrane distillation (FO-MD) hybrid system is presented to identify the challenges and potential solutions for hybrid desalination technologies. An FO process is driven by the osmotic pressure difference between two streams and produces water across a hydrophilic polymeric membrane. By using a saline solution, known as the draw solu-tion, freshwater may be recovered from a targeted feed solution stream with relatively lower salin-ity. MD is a thermal membrane process that makes use of the difference in vapor pressure between hot and cold streams to transport water vapor across the membrane to a cold permeate solution. These two membrane processes (FO and MD) are selected to treat the produced water, which is a by-product in the oil and gas industry; produced water has extremely high salinity and complex organic composition and hence is one of the most challenging wastewater streams for water treat-ment. Since FO and MD employ two different energy potentials (i.e., osmotic and thermal ener-gies, respectively), hybridization allows maximizing the use of available energy in target streams (i.e., produced water). To solve the challenge of complexity of hybridization, a novel integrated membrane module was developed for an FO-MD hybrid system. To evaluate the performance of the FO-MD hybrid system for produced water treatment, syn-thetic produced water streams were prepared according to water quality references from a conventional oil and gas production facility. Separate FO and MD experiments were conducted to study the membrane-fouling phenomena of different produced water qualities. In addition, the FO-MD hybrid system is operated with varied combinations of produced water streams for sustainability evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate the great potential of the FO-MD hybrid system for sustainable produced water treatment. Long-term operation of the hybrid system and experiments with real produced water samples are necessary for scaling up and optimizing the technology. Investigating the water–energy nexus related to the desalination technologies integrated with renewable energy is one approach to broaden the applications of hybrid desalination tech-nologies. Such a study will emphasize the advantages of hybridization despite the complex challenges. The benefits of hybrid technologies in terms of greater water production, higher recovery, and cleaner water quality will be synergized with less energy consumption by their integration with renewable energy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI)-based process design, optimization, and control will be an important tool to address the complexity of hybrid desalination technologies and will provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges, for which the conventional experimental and theoretical studies are still limited. AI algorithms, such as machine learning and artificial neural network algorithms, are the leading approaches to the advancement of AI-assisted smart desalination. © 2022 Desalination Publications.

To design a robust hybrid modelling mechanism, the Interim-ERA European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data are employed to train and cross-validate the estimation model that is formulated by an evolutionary-type algorithm: the Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) integrated with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model. The hybrid CRO-(ELM) algorithm is applied in two stages: first for the feature selection process guided by an ELM algorithm (a class of fast training neural network tool) as the model's fitness function to screen an optimal set of predictor variables and second, for the estimation of the solar radiation using the optimally screened variables by the final hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system. To benchmark the performance of the hybrid CRO-ELM algorithm for this estimation problem we apply an alternative, yet a similar feature screening approach: the Grouping Genetic Algorithm encoded into the ELM-based model (GGA-(ELM) used as the predictor mechanism). After the feature selection process is performed by the CRO algorithm that extracts the data patterns for accurate estimation the alternative objective algorithm is applied (in this case the ELM again) to formulate the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM modelling system. To provide a rigorous evaluation of the CRO-(ELM)-ELM hybrid system, alternative estimation approaches are considered: the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). The hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system is tested in a real problem where the results are evaluated by means of several statistical score metrics and diagnostic plots of the observed and the estimated daily global solar radiation in the testing phase. We show that the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM model is able to yield promising results; thus improving those attained by the 7 alternative models (i.e., hybrid CRO-(ELM)-MARS, CRO-(ELM)-MLR and CRO-(ELM)-SVR and the GGA equivalent models). The study ascertains that the CRO-based hybrid system where a large pool of predictor data are carefully screened through a wrapper-based modelling system and the ELM model is applied as a objective estimation tool can be adopted as a qualified stratagem in solar radiation estimation problems. The proposed hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system exhibits clear advantages over the alternative machine learning approaches tested and also over the other machine learning algorithms used without the feature selection tool; thus advocating its scientific utility in renewable energy applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Coral Reefs Optimization; Extreme Learning Machines; Grouping Genetic Algorithms; Hybrid modelling system; Solar radiation estimation; Australia; Queensland; Anthozoa; Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid systems; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linear regression; Optimization; Radiation; Reefs; Regression analysis; Solar radiation; Weather forecasting; Coral reef; Extreme learning machine; Grouping genetic algorithms; Hybrid modelling; Solar radiation estimation; estimation method; genetic algorithm; machine learning; model validation; numerical model; optimization; solar power; solar radiation; Evolutionary algorithms,Elsevier Ltd,03062619 (ISSN),English,Appl.

The numerical results demonstrate it is possible to reduce significantly financial risks, such as the price-quantity risk, not only by exploiting the complementarity of the considered renewable sources generation profiles, but also by selecting the optimal mix of commercialisation contracts from different markets. We find that the multi-market strategy generally results in appreciably higher optimal value than single-market strategies and can be applied to a wide range of renewable generators and contracts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Decision support system; Electricity markets; Financial risk management; Renewable energy investments; Stochastic portfolio optimisation; Brazil; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Decision support systems; Energy policy; Hydroelectric generators; Optimization; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Attitude towards risks; Electricity spot price; Financial risk management; Portfolio optimisation; Renewable energy investments; Renewable energy projects; Renewable energy source; Stochastic optimisation; commercialization; complementarity; decision making; decision support system; electricity generation; energy market; energy resource; financial provision; optimization; renewable resource; risk assessment; uncertainty analysis; Investments,Elsevier Ltd,03605442 (ISSN),English,Energy,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: S.

However, injecting these RES into the current power system network causes large voltage and power overshoots hence deteriorate the transient response and power quality of the overall power system. In this paper, an efficient solution of the above-mentioned issues is explored by developing an optimal microgrid (MG) controller using one of the most modern and intelligent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques named the salp swarm optimization algorithm (SSA). The intelligence of the SSA is exploited to select the optimal controller gains and dc-link capacitance value by minimizing a time integrating error fitness function (FF) which in-turn enhances the dynamic response and power quality of the studied MG system. The proposed grid-tied MG controller is designed to achieve the preset active and reactive power sharing ratio between distributed generator (DG) and utility grid during DG and load switching conditions. To validate the superiority of the proposed controller, its performance is compared with that of its precedent grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA)-based controller for the identical operating conditions and system configuration. The outcomes of the study show that the proposed MG controller outperforms its competitor in terms of transient response and quality of power. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",dynamic response enhancement; grid-tied microgrid; power quality; salp swarm optimization; Capacitance; Carbon dioxide; Controllers; Dynamic response; Electric power transmission networks; Optimization; Power quality; Renewable energy resources; Transient analysis; Active and Reactive Power; Carbon dioxide emissions; Distributed generators; Grid-tied microgrid; Optimization algorithms; Renewable energy source; Salp swarms; System configurations; Electric power system control,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,20507038 (ISSN),English,Int.

However, the integration brings about considerable technical challenges associated with fluctuations and uncertainties of the energy availability whilst maintaining the stability of smart grids. The prediction of renewable energy generation is key to achieve optimal power dispatch in renewable-intensive smart grids. However, uncertain interruption and prediction errors will make an optimal decision more challenging. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective way to overcome the discrepancies between the prediction and the real-world system through a closed-loop correction over iteration process. This study develops an improved MPC scheme used with a hybrid energy storage system for optimal power dispatch in a smart grid. This hybrid renewable energy system consists of a wind farm, a hydrogen/oxygen storage system and several fuel cells (FCs). In this study, particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a back propagation (BP) artificial neural network is developed to predict the wind energy availability by using measured data. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is combined with a state space model (SSM) to achieve the MPC control. A dataset of 24-hour ahead predictive generation is calibrated from the measured data and is defined for optimal power flow between the grid, the wind farm and the storage subsystem so as to balance the supply and load. The optimization target is to achieve a minimal energy exchange between the power grid and the hybrid renewable energy storage system. Based on actual measured data, the test results have shown that the proposed methodology can maximize the local usage of wind power whilst minimizing the power exchange with the grid. An optimal power dispatch strategy is proved to be effective to meet the demand and efficiency with dynamic control of the FCs. The usage of the intermittent wind power is increased from 45% to 90% in the four test studies. Therefore, this work can minimize the impact of fluctuating renewable energy on the power grid and enhance uptakes of FC-based energy systems. This is particularly economic and relevant to the remote and under-developed regions where their power networks are weak and vulnerable. © 2013 IEEE.",Fuel cells; genetic algorithm; hydrogen; model predictive control; smart grid; wind energy; Backpropagation; Digital storage; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy storage; Forecasting; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Genetic algorithms; Hydrogen; Iterative methods; Model predictive control; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Predictive control systems; Smart power grids; State space methods; Wind power; Closed-loop corrections; Energy availability; Hybrid energy storage systems; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Optimal power dispatch; Renewable energy generation; Technical challenges; Electric load dispatching,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536 (ISSN),English,IEEE Access,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 37; Correspondence Address: J.

However, randomness on its generation is a characteristic to be considered due to its direct impact on reliability and performance of these systems. For this reason, renewable generation usually is accompanied with other generation elements to improve their general performance. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the power generation system, composed of solar, wind and diesel generation and power outsourcing option from the grid as means of reserve source. A multi-objective optimization for the design of hybrid generation system is proposed, particularly using the cost of energy, two different reliability indexes and the percentage of renewable energy as objectives. Further, the uncertainty of renewable sources and demand is modeled with a new technique that permits to evaluate the reliability quickly. Design/methodology/approach-The multi-state model of the generators and the load is modeled with the Universal Generating Function (UGF) to estimate the reliability indexes for the whole system. Then an evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) is used to solve the multi-objective optimization model. Findings-The use of UGF methodology reduces the computation time, providing effective results. The validation of reliability assessment of hybrid generation systems using the UGF is carried out taking as a benchmark the results obtained with the Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed multiobjective algorithm gives as a result different generators combinations that outline hybrid systems, where some of them could be preferred over others depending on its results for each independent objective. Also it allows us to observe the changes produced on the resulting solutions due to the impact of the power fluctuation of the renewable generators. Originality/value-The main contributions of this paper are: an extended multi state model that includes different types of renewable energies, with emphasis on modeling of solar energy; demonstrate the performance improvement of UGF against SMC regarding the computational time required for this case; test the impact of different multi-states numbers for the representation of the elements; depict through multi-objective optimization, the impact of combining different energies on the cost and reliability of the resultant systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Artificial intelligence; Electric power generation; Multi-objective optimization; Power systems reliability; Renewable generation; Universal generating function; Artificial intelligence; Electric power generation; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid systems; Monte Carlo methods; Reliability; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Multi objective algorithm; Multi-objective design optimization; Multi-objective optimization models; Non- dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Power systems reliability; Renewable generation; Universal generating functions; Universal generating functions (UGF); Multiobjective optimization,Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,03321649 (ISSN),English,COMPEL Int J Comput Math Electr Electron Eng,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: J.A.

In recent years, the solar energy is drawing more attention owing to its advantages such as zero green houses emission & pollution, low maintenance cost, absence of moving parts and freedom from environmental pollution. Due to the high initial cost of Photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems and their low energy conversion efficiency, a PV system is generally operated to extract maximum power from the PV source. The objective of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is to extract maximum power generated by the PV systems under varying conditions of temperature and solar insolation. A major challenge in PV systems is to analyze the nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics so as to obtain a unique maximum power point on its power-voltage (P-V) characteristic curve. The process of MPPT is complicated due to the fact that the PV curves vary largely with solar insolation and temperature. Many researchers have proposed and implemented a variety of methods, both conventional and non-conventional, to solve MPPT problem. However, most of conventional tracking methods fail to work properly under partial shaded conditions. Partial shaded SPV modules produce several local maximum power points, making the tracking of Global Maximum Power Point (GMPP) difficult. Hence many researchers have tried to use artificial intelligence techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Colony of Fire Flies (FF), Cuckoo Search (CS), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Symbiotic Organism Search (SOS) algorithm and Fruitfly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) etc. This paper presents a review of artificial intelligence optimization techniques to address the Maximum Power Point Tracking of Solar Photovoltaic arrays under partial shaded conditions.

Due to strong seasonal variations in the wind resource, accurate predictions of wind resource assessment and appropriate wind speed distribution models (for any location) are the significant facets for planning and commissioning wind farms. In this work, the wind characteristics and wind potential assessment of onshore, o_shore, and nearshore locations of India-particularly Kayathar in Tamilnadu, the Gulf of Khambhat, and Jafrabad in Gujarat-are statistically analyzed with wind distribution methods. Further, the resource assessments are carried out using Weibull, Rayleigh, gamma, Nakagami, generalized extreme value (GEV), lognormal, inverse Gaussian, Rician, Birnbaum-Sandras, and Bimodal-Weibull distribution methods. Additionally, the advent of artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques with the moth flame optimization (MFO) method leads to superior results in solving complex problems and parameter estimations. The data analytics are carried out in the MATLAB platform, with in-house coding developed for MFO parameters estimated through optimization and other wind distribution parameters using the maximum likelihood method. The observed outcomes show that the MFO method performed well on parameter estimation. Correspondingly, wind power generation was shown to peak at the SouthWest Monsoon periods from June to September, with mean wind speeds ranging from 9 to 12 m/s. Furthermore, the wind speed distribution method of mixed Weibull, Nakagami, and Rician methods performed well in calculating potential assessments for the targeted locations.

Solar power is one of the most promising renewable energy sources that is providing its benefit specifically in rural areas. With the increasing need for solar energy, it becomes necessary to extract maximum power from the PV array. The output power of the solar cells varies directly with the ambient temperature and Irradiation. Therefore, the challenge is to track maximum power from the PV array when environmental factors change. This paper focuses on increasing the efficiency of a PV array by incorporating artificial intelligence techniques. The genetic algorithm-based optimization technique is developed in order to track maximum power at given ambient conditions. The performance of the algorithm was tested under various environmental conditions using MATLAB/Simulink.

Reasonable sizing for such power systems could improve the power supply reliability and reduce the annual system cost. The goal of this work is to optimize the size of a stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic (PV)/wind turbine (WT)/battery (B)/hydrogen system (a hybrid system based on battery and hydrogen (HS-BH)) for reliable and economic supply. Two objectives that take the minimum annual system cost and maximum system reliability described as the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) have been addressed for sizing HS-BH from a more comprehensive perspective, considering the basic demand of load, the profit from hydrogen, which is produced by HS-BH, and an effective energy storage strategy.

Several ANN computational models based on the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm, and the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and linear transfer functions were evaluated. Two ANN models (ANN1 and ANN2, characterized by using five and six input variables, respectively; and a common structure of 9 neurons in the hidden layer) were found to be the most suitable architectures for a reliable determination of geothermal pressure gradients. These ANN models used a limited number of input variables which are commonly available in field measurements (e.g., wellbore production data: pressure, temperature and mass flow rate; and wellbore geometry data). Such ANN models were effectively trained by using a wellbore production database which was compiled from several world geothermal fi elds. Additional wellbore simulation works were also carried out by using the same production data and a numerical simulator (GEOWELLLS). The pressure gradients predicted by using all these computing tools (ANNs and GEOWELLS) were statistically compared with measured field data. From this matching analysis, it was demonstrated that the ANN2 model provided the most acceptable results (with average prediction errors less than 2.3%) in comparison with those results inferred from ANN1 and GEOWELL tools.

Most likely, the economic picture would change when other ecosystem services delivered by the protected biodiversity would be taken into account.

Feed in Tariff mechanism has been applied since 2011 in Malaysia to expand utilization of renewable energy for electricity generation. In this study, a broad range of data is gathered to develop a comprehensive system dynamics model to evaluate the impacts of Feed in Tariff mechanism on the generation mix of Malaysia during a 20-year period between 2011 and 2030. Results demonstrate that although the policy may lead to a satisfactory level of target achievement but the Malaysian government may face an increasing shortage in its RE fund budget starting around 2019 unless it increases its income sources by rising the surcharges on electricity bills or decreases its expenditures by optimizing the amount of FiT payments in different periods. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that the more funding will not lead to a more sustainable generation mix unless it is paid in the right time and in the right direction. Using this model, policymakers can carry out analysis to determine the amount of money that must be collected from the electricity consumers through the surcharges on electricity bills as well as the amount of feed in tariff to be paid for different renewable resources in different periods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Decision support system; Electricity generation modelling; Energy policy; Feed in tariff; System dynamics; Malaysia; Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Decision support systems; Energy policy; Energy resources; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; System theory; Comprehensive system; Electricity consumers; Electricity generation; Feed-in tariff; Malaysian governments; Renewable energies; Renewable resource; System Dynamics; decision support system; electricity generation; energy policy; numerical model; optimization; policy making; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis; solar power; Electric power generation,Elsevier Ltd,03062619 (ISSN),English,Appl.

The interconnected HPS model consists of conventional and renewable energy sources operating in disparate combinations to balance the generation and load demand of the system. In the proffered work, the stability analysis of nonlinear dynamic HPS model was analyzed using the Hankel method of model order reduction. Also, an attempt was made to apply cascade proportional integral-proportional derivative (PI-PD) control for HPS. The gains of the controller were optimized by minimizing the integral absolute error (IAE) of area control error using particle swarm optimization-gravitational search algorithm (PSO-GSA) optimization technique. The performance of cascade control was compared with other classical controllers and the efficiency of this approach was studied for various cases of HPS model. The result shows that the cascade control produced better transient and steady state performances than those of the other classical controllers. The robustness analysis also reveals that the system overshoots/undershoots in frequency response pertaining to random change in wind power generation and load perturbations were significantly reduced by the proposed cascade control. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of the system was performed, with the variation in step load perturbation (SLP) of 1% to 5%, system loading and inertia of the system by ±25% of nominal values to prove the efficiency of the controller. Furthermore, to prove the efficiency of PSO-GSA tuned cascade control, the results were compared with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods presented in the literature.

All of these possess the natural property of self-changing behavior, so the connection of these separate independent controllable units to the grid leads to uncertainties. This creates an imbalance in active power and reactive power. In order to control the active and reactive power in wind turbine generators with adjustable speed, various control strategies are used to allay voltage and current variations. This research work is focused on the design and implementation of effective control strategies for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) to control its active and reactive power. A DFIG system with its control strategies is simulated on MATLAB software. To augment the transient stability of DFIG, the simulation results for the active and reactive power of conventional controllers are compared with three types of feed forward neural network controllers, i.e., probabilistic feedforward neural network (PFFNN), multi-layer perceptron feedforward neural network (MLPFFN) and radial basic function feedforward neural network (RBFFN) for optimum performance. Conclusive outcomes clearly manifest the superior robustness of the RBFNN controller over other controllers in terms of rise time, settling time and overshoot value. © 2020 by the authors.

SMGs must be self-sufficient and operate independently; however, when more elements are integrated into SMGs, as distributed energy resources (DER), traditional explicit mathematical formulations will demand too much data from the network and become intractable. In contrast, tools based on optimization with metaheuristics can provide near optimal solutions in acceptable times. Considering this, this paper presents the variable neighborhood search differential evolutionary particle swarm optimization (VNS-DEEPSO) algorithm to solve multi-objective stochastic control models, as SMGs system operation. The goal is to control DER while maximizing profit. In this work, DER considered the bidirectional communication between energy storage systems (ESS) and electric vehicles (EVs). They can charge/discharge power and buy/sell energy in the electricity markets. Also, they have elements such as traditional generators (e.g., reciprocating engines) and loads, with demand response/control capability. Sources of uncertainty are associated with weather conditions, planned EV trips, load forecasting and the market prices.

This paper addresses the hybridization of the micronuclear reactor and Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) Energy Sources (RESs) to develop a flexible, cost-effective, sustainable, and resilient off-grid Hybrid Energy System (HES). The paper presents three types of hybridization methods, termed ‘‘Direct Coupling,’’ ‘‘Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling,’’ and ‘‘Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling.’’ The hybridization techniques are used to plan and identify the most efficient Nuclear-Renewable Micro-Hybrid Energy System (N-R MHES). The sizing, performance, and characterization of N-R MHES solely depend on the RES and load characteristics’ availability. Based on proposed hybridization techniques, mathematical modeling of N-R MHES’s economy is carried out in the MATLAB environment. An artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used to minimize the Net Present Cost (NPC) and achieve the optimal system configurations of different N-R MHESs.

How to make efficient utilization of radio resource and renewable energy is a brand-new challenge. This paper investigates the optimal policy for user scheduling and resource allocation in HetNets powered by hybrid energy with the purpose of maximizing energy efficiency of the overall network. Since wireless channel conditions and renewable energy arrival rates have stochastic properties and the environment's dynamics are unknown, the model-free reinforcement learning approach is used to learn the optimal policy through interactions with the environment. To solve our problem with continuous-valued state and action variables, a policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithm is proposed. The actor part uses the Gaussian distribution as the parameterized policy to generate continuous stochastic actions, and the policy parameters are updated with the gradient ascent method. The critic part uses compatible function approximation to estimate the performance of the policy and helps the actor learn the gradient of the policy. The advantage function is used to further reduce the variance of the policy gradient. Using the numerical simulations, we demonstrate the convergence property of the proposed algorithm and analyze network energy efficiency. © 2002-2012 IEEE.",actor-critic reinforcement learning; energy efficiency; renewable energy; resource allocation; User scheduling; Base stations; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Energy resources; Heterogeneous networks; Optimization; Random processes; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wireless telecommunication systems; Actor-critic reinforcement learning; Learning (artificial intelligence); Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Resource management; User scheduling; Wireless communications; Renewable energy resources,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15361276 (ISSN),English,IEEE Trans.

Frequency reserves are resources that adjust power production or consumption in real time to react to a power grid frequency deviation. Revenue generation motivates the availability of these resources for managing such deviations. However, limited research has been conducted on data-driven decisions and optimal bidding strategies for trading such capacities in multiple frequency reserves markets. We address this limitation by making the following research contributions. Firstly, a generalized model is designed based on an extensive study of critical characteristics of global frequency reserves markets. Secondly, three bidding strategies are proposed, based on this market model, to capitalize on price peaks in multi-stage markets. Two strategies are proposed for non-reschedulable loads, in which case the bidding strategy aims to select the market with the highest anticipated price, and the third bidding strategy focuses on rescheduling loads to hours on which highest reserve market prices are anticipated. The third research contribution is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based bidding optimization framework that implements these three strategies, with novel uncertainty metrics that supplement data-driven price prediction. Finally, the framework is evaluated empirically using a case study of multiple frequency reserves markets in Finland.

Therefore, the electricity generation by wind and solar resources have had greater applicability in recent years. Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) integrates renewable sources and storage systems, increasing the reliability of generators. For the sizing of HRES, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) stand out. This article presents the sizing of an HRES for the Colombian context, taking into account the energy consumption by three typical demands, four types of wind turbines, three types of solar panels, and a storage system for the system configuration. Two optimization approaches were set-up with both optimization strategies (i.e., GA and PSO). The first one implies the minimization of the Loss Power Supply Probability (LPSP). In contrast, the second one concerns adding the Total Annual Cost (TAC) or the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to the objective function. Results obtained show that HRES can supply the energy demand, where the PSO method gives configurations that are more adjusted to the considered electricity demands. © 2020 by the authors.

A hybrid artificial intelligence based multiple stage solution methodology is envisaged to provide a techno-economical optimal solution to the problem. The proposed methodology provides economically better solution to the Unit Commitment problem of ten thermal generators when integrated with battery supported wind and solar generation.

ED is howto schedule the real power outputs from the available generators to get the minimum cost while satisfying all constraints of the network. Moreover, it may be explained as allocating generation among the committed units with the most effective minimum way in accordance with all constraints of the system. There are many traditional methods for solving ED, e.g., Newton-Raphson method Lambda-Iterative technique, Gaussian-Seidel method, etc. All these traditional methods need the generators' incremental fuel cost curves to be increasing linearly. But practically the input-output characteristics of a generator are highly non-linear. This causes a challenging non-convex optimization problem. Recent techniques like genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence, dynamic programming and particle swarm optimization solve nonconvex optimization problems in a powerful way and obtain a rapid and near global optimum solution. In addition, renewable energy resources as wind and solar are a promising option due to the environmental concerns as the fossil fuels reserves are being consumed and fuel price increases rapidly and emissions are getting higher. Therefore, the world tends to replace the old power stations into renewable ones or hybrid stations. In this paper, it is attempted to enhance the operation of electrical power system networks via economic dispatch. An ED problem is solved using various techniques, e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique and Sine-Cosine Algorithm (SCA). Afterwards, the results are compared. Moreover, case studies are executed using a photovoltaic-based distributed generator with constant penetration level on the IEEE 14 bus system and results are observed.

During such emergencies, system operators need to redistribute power quickly and adequately. This paper presents a heuristic decision support system for alleviating line overloads and mitigating the consequences of cascading events. A graph-partitioning algorithm is developed to identify the subnetworks for which the overloaded lines act as power gates. Inter-subnetwork power shifts by generation rescheduling and, possibly, load shedding are applied to relieve the overloaded lines which bridge these subnetworks. The power shifts are selected based on their potential to simultaneously reduce overloads and prevent new ones. This multi-objective decision making is based on the sensitivities of the overloaded lines with respect to power shifts and on the time required to complete them. Line overloads are eliminated by guiding the formation of self-sufficient subnetworks. The framework has been tested on the modified RTS-96 and on the IEEE 118 systems to illustrate its capability of load shedding reduction using a developed cascading outages simulation model. A novel optimization method which minimizes the redispatch time is formulated to validate the proposed framework, and the impact of considering ramping rates is shown with comparison to standard optimization based on minimizing redispatch power. The sensitivity-based method identifies compromise solutions which minimize the redispatch power and the redispatch time, and support the dispatcher's decision making by providing further corrective actions alternative to normal OPF. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The recent trends and advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led the development of Swarm Intelligence (SI) based optimized controllers for smooth Renewable Energy Sources (RES) penetration and optimal voltage, frequency, and power-sharing regulation. Moreover, the recent studies have proved that the SI-based controllers provide enhanced dynamic response, optimized power quality and improved the dynamic stability of the MG systems as compared to the conventional control methods. Their importance in modern AC MG architectures can be judged from the growing number of publications in the recent past.

Tupper 2007, Santiago, Chile","The fast construction times of projects based on variable generation technologies (VGTs) such as photovoltaic and wind generation, together with growing difficulties for building new transmission lines due to socio-environmental requirements, have opened new challenges in the development of sustainable power systems. Due to the complexity of the Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP) problem, current models are usually oversimplified and do not always meet the requirements needed for the practical application. Examples of these simplifications are the use of reduced network equivalents, limiting the planning horizon to one or a few years and limiting the expansion options to adding new lines in given corridors. To meet the new challenges and achieve a time-effective increase of the transmission capacity for the integration of VGTs, improved models and algorithms capable of taking into account a higher degree of detail in the TNEP problem are needed. In this article, a novel meta-heuristic multi-year TNEP model based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is presented. One of the main characteristics of the model is that it enables us to consider simultaneously further expansion options such as line reconductoring, voltage uprating, and adding series compensation to lines. We tested the proposed ACO model with the Garver's 6-bus test system and a modified version of the IEEE 118-bus test system, assuming a significant incorporation of VGTs. The results obtained for a 15-year planning task show (i) an excellent performance of the model in terms of quality of the obtained solution and computational times, compared to the traditional MILP approach, and (ii) including line uprating options within the multi-year TNEP brings significant benefits such as reducing the total investment and congestion costs of the system as well as the number of lines to be built. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Ant colony optimization; Line reconductoring; Renewable energies; Series compensation; Transmission network expansion planning; Voltage uprating; Artificial intelligence; Electric power transmission; Environmental technology; Expansion; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Investments; Traffic congestion; Re-conductoring; Renewable energies; Series compensation; Transmission network expansion planning; Uprating; Ant colony optimization,Elsevier Ltd,01420615 (ISSN),English,Int J Electr Power Energy Syst,Article,Scopus,"Export Date: 27 September 2024; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: R.

Connection of distributed generations (DGs) in the distribution system offers advantages in terms of reducing distribution and transmission costs as well as encouraging the use of renewable energy sources. The power flow in the distribution systems is no longer moving in a single direction and this resulted the system to become as active distribution networks (ADN). One of the main problems in ADN is the voltage regulation issue which is to maintain the voltage to be within its permissible limits. Several methods of voltage control methods are available and focus is given in finding the optimal voltage control using artificial intelligence techniques. This paper presents an optimal and coordinated voltage control method while minimizing losses and voltage deviation of the network. The optimal and coordinated voltage control scheme is implemented on an IEEE 13 bus distribution network for loss and voltage deviation minimization in the networks. Firefly Algorithm (FA) which is a known heuristic optimization technique for finding the optimal solution is used in this work. The results are compared with another optimization method known as Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) for identifying the best setting for solving the voltage regulation problem. In order to solve the multi-objective optimization issue, the MATPOWER load flow simulation is integrated in the MATLAB environment with the optimization algorithm.

Both the system are very unreliable in itself without sufficient capacity storage devices like batteries or back-up system like conventional engine generators. The reliability of the system significantly increases when two systems are hybridized with the provision of storage device. Even in such case, sufficient battery bank capacity is required to provide power to the load in extended cloudy days and non-windy days. Therefore the optimal sizing of system component represents the important part of hybrid power system. This paper summarizes recent trends of energy usage from renewable sources. It discusses physical modeling of renewable energy systems, several methodologies and criteria for optimization of the Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES). HRES is getting popular in the present scenario of energy and environmental crises. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the current state of optimization techniques specifically suited for the small and isolated power system based on the published literatures. The recent trend in optimization in the field of hybrid renewable energy system shows that artificial intelligence may provide good optimization of system without extensive long term weather data. © 2015 Korean Society for Precision Engineering.",Hybrid renewable energy systems; Hydro; Mathematical modeling; Optimization; Photovoltaic(PV); Wind; Electric batteries; Electric generators; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Optimization; Virtual storage; Wind; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES); Hybrid renewable energy systems; Hydro; Isolated power system; Optimization techniques; Photovoltaic; Renewable energy systems; Renewable energy resources,Korean Society for Precision Engineering,22886206 (ISSN),English,Int.
