AB  - Optimizing domestic energy use and increasing the efficiency of residential power supply chains depend much on home energy management (HEM) systems. This paper examines the utilization of advanced meta-heuristics, namely the Siberian Tiger Optimization (STO) and Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (SCSO) algorithms, for developing HEM systems. The paper presents an integrated STSC algorithm, enhanced by artificial intelligence, that monitors and optimizes household energy usage. To optimize electricity distribution, this algorithm seeks a compromise between reducing costs and lowering the peak-to-average proportion of power. After extensive simulations, the STSC algorithm outperforms previous meta-heuristics in Peak Average Ratio. It demonstrates the possibility of substantial cost reductions in residential settings, reaching up to 8.5%. This improves the overall efficiency of households’ power supply chains. In addition to reducing costs, the STSC algorithm contributes to sustainability objectives by utilizing AI to minimize carbon emissions, including renewable energy sources, and facilitate adaptable demand solutions. This highlights its role in promoting sustainable supply chain practices in energy efficiency. The combined use of STO and SCSO algorithms in the STSC method is a new and innovative development in HEM systems. This study highlights the capacity of AI-driven technologies to effectively and environmentally optimize household energy consumption. © 2024 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University

AB  - Jeju Island faces curtailment problems when renewable energy generation exceeds the facility capacity. In addition, the renewable energy system cannot achieve consistent operation because of the uncertainty of renewable energy sources (RES) and their complex spatiotemporal patterns. Climate change and extreme meteorological phenomena also affect the energy system of the island. Therefore, it is essential to maximize RES exploitation to accomplish carbon-free energy production. This study developed a rolling horizon optimization–based flexible renewable energy distribution planning (FxRE-Plan) based on an artificial intelligence-driven spatiotemporal RES prediction model. An adaptive graph convolutional recurrent network (AGCRN) was used to develop a spatiotemporal prediction model. Then, FxRE-Plan was determined using a multiobjective genetic algorithm to maximize the RES potential under climate change scenarios. The FxRE-Plan was evaluated and compared with the current operation of the electric grid in Jeju Island through economic, environmental cost, and climate change vulnerability assessment index. The results of this research show that the AGCRN–based spatiotemporal prediction model exhibited superior prediction performance, achieving a 95% R2. In addition, the FxRE-Plan reduced greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 11.5% at maximum and climate change vulnerability. Hence, the proposed FxRE-Plan can be used to solve curtailments in real electric grids by pursuing carbon-free islands. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the last decade, many artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used to solve various problems in sustainable energy (SE). Consequently, an increasing volume of research has been devoted to this topic, making it difficult for researchers to keep abreast of its developments. This paper analyzes 18,715 articles—about AI techniques used for SE—indexed in Scopus and published from 2013 to 2022, which were retrieved and selected following a novel iterative methodology. Besides calculating basic bibliometric indicators, we used clustering techniques and a co-occurrence analysis of author keywords to discover and characterize dominant themes in the literature. As a result, we found eight dominant themes in SE (solar energy, smart grids and microgrids, fuel cells, hydrogen, electric vehicles, biofuels, wind energy, and energy planning) and nine dominant techniques in AI (genetic algorithms, support vector machines, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, classical neural networks, fuzzy logic controllers, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and multi-objective optimization). Each dominant theme is discussed in detail, highlighting the most relevant work and contributions. Finally, we identified the AI techniques most widely used in each SE area to solve its specific problems. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The increasing global need for renewable energy sources, driven by environmental concerns and the limited availability of traditional energy, highlights the significance of solar energy. However, weather fluctuations challenge the efficiency of solar systems, making maximum power point tracking (MPPT) systems crucial for optimal energy harvesting. This study compares ten MPPT approaches, including both conventional and artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques. These controllers were designed and implemented using MATLAB Simulink, and their performance was evaluated under real environmental conditions with fluctuating irradiance and temperature. The results demonstrate that conventional techniques, such as incremental conductance (INC), Perturb and Observe (P&O), Incremental conductance and Particle Swam Optimization (INC-PSO), Fuzzy Logic Control and Particle Swam Optimization (FLC-PSO), and Perturb and Observe and Particle Swam Optimization (P&O-PSO), achieved accuracies of 94%, 97.6%, 98.9%, 98.7%, and 99.3% respectively. In contrast, AI-based intelligent techniques, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Artificial Neural Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS), Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC), Particle Swam Optimization (PSO), and Artificial Neural Network and Particle Swam Optimization (ANN-PSO), outperform achieving higher accuracies of 97.8%, 99.9%, 98.9%, 99.2%, and 99%, respectively. Compared to available research, which often reports lower accuracies for conventional techniques, our study highlights the enhanced performance of AI-based methods. This study provides a comprehensive comparative analysis, delivering critical analysis and practical guidance for engineers and researchers in selecting the most effective MPPT controller optimized to specific environmental conditions. By improving the efficiency and reliability of solar power systems, our research supports the advancement of sustainable energy solutions. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Renewable energy has garnered attention due to the need for sustainable energy sources. Wind power has emerged as an alternative that has contributed to the transition towards cleaner energy. As the importance of wind energy grows, it can be crucial to provide forecasts that optimize its performance potential. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have risen in prominence due to how well they can handle complicated systems while enhancing the accuracy of prediction. This study explored the area of AI to predict wind-energy production at a wind farm in Yalova, Turkey, using four different AI approaches: support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Wind speed and direction were considered as essential input parameters, with wind energy as the target parameter, and models are thoroughly evaluated using metrics such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The findings accentuate the superior performance of the SVM, which delivered the lowest MAPE (2.42%), the highest R2 (0.95), and the lowest MAE (71.21%) compared with actual values, while ANFIS was less effective in this context. The main aim of this comparative analysis was to rank the models to move to the next step in improving the least efficient methods by combining them with optimization algorithms, such as metaheuristic algorithms. © 2023 Global Energy Interconnection Group Co.

AB  - The paper proposes a control strategy for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) system that integrates a photovoltaic (PV) based renewable energy system (RES) and battery and supercapacitor (SC) based energy storage systems (ESS). In the proposed system, a current fed converter is implemented for the photovoltaic and supercapacitor which is a power electronic converter that operates by controlling the current flow in the circuit. The benefit of these converters is that core saturation and shot through cannot lead to device failure or half cycle symmetry. This is a feature of silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) based converters and is a key factor in the increased durability of these converters. A power bi-directional converter is employed for the battery in the EV system. This converter enables the battery to both charge and discharge power as required by the system which facilitates the energy flow between the battery and the rest of the system, allowing efficient energy management and utilization within the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Additionally, to efficiently utilize the photovoltaic system, an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to determine the maximum power points (MPPs). A robust nonlinear higher order super twisting sliding mode controller (STSMC) and integral terminal sliding mode controller (ITSMC) have been designed for PHEVs to reduced chattering phenomena. Tables V to X provides a detailed comparison of error performance metrics and transient response characteristics for the state of charge of a renewable energy system and energy storage systems under the control of the optimized STSMC and ITSMC. The global asymptotic stability of the control approach is verified using Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, MATLAB/Simulink and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are done to show the behavior of proposed system (Pirouzi et al., 2022). © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Cogeneration power plants traditionally rely on fossil fuels to produce stable power and heat. However, increasing energy demand and population growth have intensified the emission of biological pollutants due to fossil fuel use. The Global Alliance on Health and Pollution advocates for integrating renewable energy sources to mitigate these issues. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the integration of a solar-biomass polygeneration system with a hybrid solar-waste-fossil fuel cogeneration system. The goal is to analyze the system from technical, economic, and environmental perspectives, focusing on optimizing energy demand and minimizing environmental impact. Methods: To assess energy demand and supply, the R-curve methodology was applied to the hybrid cogeneration system, with a specific focus on solar and biomass renewable energies. Various scenarios were analyzed, including total annual costs, pollutant emissions, water footprint, and overall environmental impact based on life cycle assessment. The study examined and compared the performance of three types of biomass waste (Municipal solid waste, mixed paper waste, and date palm waste). Multi-objective optimization was performed using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, employing four meta-heuristic algorithms. The conditions generated by each algorithm were analyzed and compared. Results: Municipal solid waste, being the most readily available fuel, provided the most favorable economic conditions for the system. Environmentally, municipal solid waste ranked in the middle compared to other fuels. Among the optimization algorithms, the Salps swarm algorithm proved to be the most efficient in terms of calculation time and system efficiency improvements. The optimization improved net power generation by 5.25 %, overall energy efficiency by 16.27 %, total cost rate by 10.19 %, and total environmental impact rate by 14.02 %. Conclusion: The integrated system's performance was analyzed across different climatic change throughout the year. The multi-objective Salps swarm algorithm optimization demonstrated significant benefits in enhancing system efficiency and reducing costs and environmental impacts. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - This study presents an innovative approach to aquaponics by integrating artificial intelligence (AI). The system addresses sustainability challenges by utilizing a novel approach to machine learning to create a fully sustainable system that improves nutrition and fish growth in aquaponics. The study focuses on predicting the length and weight of fish species by analyzing different environmental parameters, including pH, ammonia, and nitrate levels. Data preprocessing integrates nearest-neighbor interpolation and feature standardization to ensure quality and consistency. The light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM) machine learning model, optimized by five-fold cross-validation, emerges as the superior predictor. Moreover, a novel aspect of the study is the integration of local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) for enhanced model transparency. The outcome helps to understand the impacts of individual characteristics on the predictions. External validation using different data reaffirms the models' generalizability. Hence, the integration of renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and rigorous analysis shows the potential to improve sustainable agriculture, paving the way for efficient and environmentally conscious indoor farming practices. However, the main framework of this study has the advantage of replicating other fish species using a new set of parameters. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - With the rapid growth in the proportion of renewable energy access and the structural complexity of distributed energy systems, traditional microgrid (MG) scheduling methods that rely on mathematical optimization models and expert experience are facing significant challenges. Therefore, it is essential to present a novel scheduling technique with high intelligence and fast decision-making capacity to realize MGs’ automatic operation and regulation. This paper proposes an optimal scheduling decision-making method for MGs based on deep neural networks (DNN). Firstly, a typical mathematical scheduling model used for MG operation is introduced, and the limitations of current methods are analyzed. Then, a two-stage optimal scheduling framework comprising day-ahead and intra-day stages is presented. The day-ahead part is solved by mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and the intra-day part uses a convolutional neural network (CNN)—bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi LSTM) for high-speed rolling decision making, with the outputs adjusted by a power correction balance algorithm. Finally, the validity of the model and algorithm of this paper are verified by arithmetic case analysis. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This article introduces a cutting-edge energy system to meet the residential building's high energy demands while lowering emissions and related operating expenses. The central concept revolves around rule-based control strategies designed to exploit wastewater's heat, accounting for a substantial amount of the total heating demand in residential buildings. The system is also integrated with heat pumps to recover the radiators' return water energy to preheat the ventilation air passively. Naturally-driven borehole thermal energy storage is added for post-cooling the ventilation air to incorporate higher renewable shares in building energy systems while lowering CO2 emission. TRNSYS and MATLAB software are used to design, control, optimize, and assess the system's performance from technological, environmental, and economic perspectives with the aid of artificial intelligence. According to the results, the proposed smart system is superior due to higher efficiency and lower energy cost while saving CO2 emissions compared to the conventional ventilation system. The results further show that the suggested smart integration effectively meets needs and reduces dependency on the centralized energy network by independently recovering or producing thermal energy through the developed control framework. According to the artificial neural network-assisted optimization outcomes, energy cost, total cost, and CO2 index are reduced by about 41.5 USD.MWh−1, 10,306 USD, and 1.7 kg.MWh−1, respectively. Furthermore, there is an annual extra 3 kWh of improved energy generation thanks to the optimal storage/usage of energy. The results further show that strategic optimization techniques like reducing mass flow rate and borehole depth perform well to maximize efficiency while reducing environmental impact and saving significant money. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using energy storage technologies in combination with renewable energy sources can improve power generation efficiency and reliability. Here, we predict the performance of a wind farm-based molten salt energy storage system combined with a supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle (s-CO2BC) with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). For this purpose, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are applied to train a Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN). The proposed AI approaches model the complex interactions between the wind farm, the molten salt energy storage, and the s-CO2BC components. Integrated system simulations under various operating conditions are used for training the performance prediction model. Power generation, energy storage, and system efficiency can all be accurately predicted by a trained AI model. In addition to providing valuable insight into the optimal operation and control strategies of the integrated system, the proposed approach enables the efficient utilization of renewable energy resources and energy storage to generate sustainable power. This study contributes to the development of AI-based optimization approaches and predicts the performance of integrated renewable energy systems, resulting in improved grid integration and stability. According to the results, the PSO method yields average absolute percentage deviations (AAPDs) between 0.47% and 0.51% across different parameters, while GOA yields AAPDs between 0.05% and 0.27%. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The penetration of distributed renewable energy sources degrades the protection of microgrids, which leads to incorrect data flow in the energy systems. It is critical to detect faults, types of defects and location of faults in order to improve the protection and security of microgrids. To cater this issue in hybrid renewable energy system, a novel fault detection scheme is adopted using artificial intelligence. The renewable energy based microgrid system is implemented in the IEEE 13 bus power network to obtain the normal and faulty voltage and current data. The system is simulated using MatLab/Simulink platform. From the time series data, the features are decomposed using empirical wavelet transform (EWT). First, EWT evaluates the frequency components in the signal, then calculates the bounds and gets the basis of the oscillating components. The obtained samples are classified using a Hybrid Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (HCRNN) and optimized by the Pelican Optimization Algorithm. The 11 types of faults are identified along with the location of fault in the system is obtained. The results are compared with the existing methods and found that the proposed method has improved the fault sample detection accuracy by 1.56%. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The use of renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly widespread around the world due to various factors, the most relevant of which is the high environmental friendliness of these types of energy resources. However, the large-scale involvement of green energy leads to the creation of distributed energy networks that combine several different generation methods, each of which has its own specific features, and as a result, the data collection and processing necessary to optimize the operation of such energy systems become more relevant. Development of new technologies for the more optimal use of RES is one of the main tasks of modern research in the field of energy, where an important place is assigned to the use of technologies based on artificial intelligence, allowing researchers to significantly increase the efficiency of the use of all types of RES within energy systems. This paper proposes to consider the methodology of application of modern approaches to the assessment of the amount of energy obtained from renewable energy sources based on artificial intelligence technologies, approaches used for data processing and for optimization of the control processes for operating energy systems with the integration of renewable energy sources. The relevance of the work lies in the formation of a general approach applied to the evaluation of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy based on the use of artificial intelligence technologies. As a verification of the approach considered by the authors, a number of models for predicting the amount of solar power generation using photovoltaic panels have been implemented, for which modern machine-learning methods have been used. As a result of testing for quality and accuracy, the best results were obtained using a hybrid forecasting model, which combines the joint use of a random forest model applied at the stage of the normalization of the input data, exponential smoothing model, and LSTM model. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Increasing energy demand in today's world emphasizes the importance of optimal scheduling for distributed energy resources to minimize energy costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The efficiency of this decision-making process relies on accurate modeling. In this paper, reinforcement learning (RL), an artificial intelligence-based approach, is proposed to optimize the energy management system (EMS) of an energy hub (EH). This EH contains renewable energy resources (RER), a combined heat and power (CHP), and a gas furnace. In order to meet electrical and thermal energy demand, available options such as day-ahead and real-time purchases from the main grid, RERs, and natural gas consumption are managed, with the preference of RERs to minimize GHG emissions and energy costs. With the adaptable RL method, a non-linear model of the CHP operation is constructed, considering the operational costs of the CHP. Furthermore, the natural gas tariff is varied according to the consumption level of the microgrid. Finally, this paper presents an RL-based method for EMS optimization of an EH with day-ahead and real-time scheduling, applied to a 24-hour case study with linear and nonlinear modeling of the problem and sensitivity analysis of the parameters. Corresponding simulation results show the efficiency of the presented approach. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The escalating issues of high energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers (DCs) necessitate the optimization of system operations. However, early optimization strategies were overly simplistic and lacked automated updating and iterative capabilities. With the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have applied deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms to system operations. However, the optimization focus has been limited to the internal systems, lacking global optimization. In this paper, a global optimization control strategy based on the Dueling double-deep Q network (D3QN) and value decomposition network (VDN) algorithms is proposed to make the DCs system operate more closely with the upstream, midstream, and downstream. By adjusting battery charging/discharging capacity, computational workload, and waste heat utilization heating temperature global synergistic optimization is achieved. Compared with without optimization, renewable energy waste, operation cost, total electricity consumption, and grid electricity consumption are reduced by 18.37%, 9.78%, 4.01%, and 29.74%, respectively. Additionally, a detailed comparison between non-algorithmic optimization and algorithmic optimization is provided, offering valuable insights for substantial energy savings and emissions reduction in DCs. The results demonstrate the importance of fully exploring the interactive potential between upstream energy supply, midstream computational workload, and downstream waste heat recovery to achieve synergistic global optimization of “computing power", “thermal energy" and “electrical energy" for the sustainable and green development of DCs or other prosumer buildings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate parameter estimation of the equivalent circuit model (ECM) for Li-Ion batteries (LiBs) allows for better behavior modeling and understanding. This is crucial for various applications, such as battery management systems (BMSs) and renewable energy systems, as it enables more precise performance prediction and optimization. This article introduces a novel artificial intelligence (AI) approach to estimate the ECM parameters of LiBs. The proposed method leverages the innovative weIghted meaN oF vectOrs (INFO) algorithm to optimize ECM parameter values. INFO combines multiple vectors, considering their relative importance, to generate a single vector. The algorithm minimizes the disparity between the ECM's estimated voltage and the battery's measured voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed method is assessed using a test profile based on real-world driving data. Furthermore, A comparative analysis is conducted with other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, including Artificial Ecosystem Optimizer (AEO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (AHA), Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), Leader Harris Hawks Optimization (LHHO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Adolescent Identity Search Algorithm (AISA). Results demonstrate that the INFO outperforms these methods in terms of accuracy and convergence speed. The proposed INFO algorithm offers a promising approach for accurate parameter estimation in LIB modeling, contributing to improved BMS and enhanced performance prediction. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As global urbanization accelerates, harmonizing water, energy, and food (WEF) resources within urban contexts is pivotal for sustainable development. This study introduces the Intelligent Urban Metabolism Framework (IUMF) for synergizing WEF dynamics, with a focus on socio-technological linkages and environmental concerns arising from climate change. Through a pioneering fusion of system dynamics simulation, machine learning surrogate, metaheuristic optimization, and multi-criteria decision making techniques, IUMF offers a transformative approach to resource management under climate uncertainty. Leveraging comprehensive data sourced from Taipei, Taiwan, this study demonstrates noteworthy enhancements in WEF nexus synergies, including a 9% boost in water supply, an 8% rise in energy benefits, and a significant 13.8% increase in food production. The cases corresponding to the best solutions under the scenario depicting a wet year and high solar radiation intensity would attain the largest benefits: 873 million m3 of water supply (water sector), 90.3 million USD of power benefits (energy sector), and 79 million kg of food production (food sector). These advancements are achieved while reducing computational runtime from 20 h to 30 min. By fostering a user-friendly interface and embracing an intelligent framework, IUMF catalyzes urban sustainability efforts. Our study highlights the potential of intelligent frameworks in addressing complex urban challenges and guiding the evolution of resource-efficient systems and offers a blueprint for a more resilient and sustainable urban future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Prediction of Power Quality (PQ) on a daily basis is inevitable in planning Renewable Energy (RE) supply and scheduling the assumed power load in smart off-grid autonomous systems. Various combinations of the attached household appliances lead to specific operating states, related to the charge and load switching-time in different out-side conditions. Complexity and irregularities require modelling with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to represent the uncertainty in load transitions and RE power oscillations. These specifics cannot be numerically solved with respect to unexpected states in detached micro-grid systems showing great variability. Recent Differential Learning, developed by the author, using a novel designed neuro-computing approach, enables one to model high non-linear and indefinable chaotic physical systems. The optimal training periods of day-set records were initially pre-assessed, based on AI input-output statistics. This model initialization allows operable day-ahead PQ-predictions in processing the last 24-hour series in one sequence. The proposed 2-level PQ-management evaluates initial load scheduling plans, based on available RE and storage sources. System efficiency and failure-free operations are planned considering the first estimate of its day-ahead PVP supply and secondary PQ verification of the provided load utilization schemes, under various state charges and RE production limits. This is a novelty with a notable incremental improvement in the published combinatorial optimization algorithms, only scheduling applicable load components, and reassessing the allowable power-day resources. Off-grid optimal operations can be determined and regulated by an adequate early morning PQ evaluation in RE utilization. A C++ parametric software, using differential learning to evolve PQ-models, historical PQ & meteo-data sets are at disposal to enable additional comparisons with the presented models. © 2022 The Franklin Institute

AB  - Contemporary distribution networks can be seen with diverse dispatchable and non-dispatchable energy resources. The coordinated scheduling of these dispatchable resources with non-dispatchable resources can provide several techno-economic and social benefits. Since battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and microturbine units are capital intensive. A thorough investigation of their coordinated scheduling on a purely economic basis will be an interesting and challenging task while considering dynamic electricity price and uncertainty of renewable power generation and load demand. This paper proposes a new methodology for optimal coordinated scheduling of BESSs and microturbine units considering existing renewable energy resources and dynamic electricity price to maximize daily profit function of the utility. In this study, a recently explored modified African buffalo optimization algorithm is employed. The key attributes of the proposed methodology are comprised of mean price-based adaptive scheduling embedded within a decision mechanism system to maximize arbitrage benefits. Decision mechanism system keeps a track of system states as a-priori thus guides the artificial intelligence-based solution technique for sequential optimization. This may also reduce the computational burden of complex real-life engineering optimization problems. Further, a novel concept of fictitious charges in coordination with BESS management algorithm is proposed to restrict the counterproductive operational management of BESSs. The application results investigated and compared on a benchmark 33-bus test distribution system highlights the importance of the proposed methodology. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Load forecasting in Smart Grids (SG) is a major module of current energy management systems, that play a vital role in optimizing resource allocation, improving grid stability, and assisting the combination of renewable energy sources (RES). It contains the predictive of electricity consumption forms over certain time intervals. Load Forecasting remains a stimulating task as load data has exhibited changing patterns because of factors such as weather change and shifts in energy usage behaviour. The beginning of advanced data analytics and machine learning (ML) approaches; particularly deep learning (DL) has mostly enhanced load forecasting accuracy. Deep neural networks (DNNs) namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved popularity for their capability to capture difficult temporal dependencies in load data. This study designs a Short-Load Forecasting scheme using a Hybrid Deep Learning and Beluga Whale Optimization (LFS-HDLBWO) approach. The major intention of the LFS-HDLBWO technique is to predict the load in the SG environment. To accomplish this, the LFS-HDLBWO technique initially uses a Z-score normalization approach for scaling the input dataset. Besides, the LFS-HDLBWO technique makes use of convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory with an autoencoder (CBLSTM-AE) model for load prediction purposes. Finally, the BWO algorithm could be used for optimal hyperparameter selection of the CBLSTM-AE algorithm, which helps to enhance the overall prediction results. A wide-ranging experimental analysis was made to illustrate the better predictive results of the LFS-HDLBWO method. The obtained value demonstrates the outstanding performance of the LFS-HDLBWO system over other existing DL algorithms with a minimum average error rate of 3.43 and 2.26 under FE and Dayton grid datasets, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a solution to the energy planning problem in buildings by implementing the net Zero Energy cost Building (nZEcB), a new concept that refers to buildings with zero or almost zero annual energy costs, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as bidirectional long short-term memory, ordinary least squares linear regression, K-means, Pearson's correlation, decision tree, and binary gravitational search algorithm. AI techniques are used to design the optimal structure of a distributed generation system. The system includes wind and photovoltaic renewable energy sources, a battery bank, and an automated capacitor bank for power factor compensation. A case study was conducted in a real public building with an annual consumption of 1.748 GWh, which resulted in the specification of a distributed generation system with a generation of 2.805 GWh per year. This system meets approximately 160.5% of the building's electrical demand and 99.999% of annual energy costs, i.e., attending the nZEcB concept. The excess production of approximately 60% of the energy is necessary because the exported energy (feed-in tariff) has a lower value than that imported from the network, having to deduct costs with demand, in addition to having to compensate for losses in the battery banks. The project has a payback period of 6.79 years. This novel study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using AI techniques to achieve nZEcBs more efficiently, economically and sustainably. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Public lighting system represents a key role in the energy transition process, considering the high electricity consumptions related to this sector. The integration of renewables could be suitable for this application and many solutions of solar-based lamps for street lighting are spreading. In this research work, a specific application of a PV-integrated lighting system was installed in the center of Italy along a footpath and monitored for several months, both in terms of electricity parameters and lighting behavior. It is equipped with monocrystalline photovoltaic cells, a lithium-based battery, and a LED lamp. The measured data allow the development of an optimization algorithm in Python program for the correct management of the solar streetlamp and the forecasting of electricity consumptions for different boundary conditions (e.g. Italian geographical position). The energy taken from grid in a year is very low with respect to a traditional lamp not powered by renewables: only 43-46% in central-northern regions and 35% in south region. Data are also used to study the possible substitution of all the traditional lamppost of the walkway with the novel proposed system. A technical-economic analysis is carried out to analyze the effectiveness of this solution not only in terms of electricity consumptions reduction, but also costs savings. The suitability of the investment and the payback time depend on Italian national price of electricity and initial cost of the solar lamp. The results can be applied to similar case studies in Italy to save electricity consumptions and reduce CO2 emissions. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In the energy production sector, increasing the quantity and efficiency of renewable energies, such as hydropower plants, is crucial to mitigate climate change. This paper proposes a new and flexible model for optimising operational decisions in watershed systems with interconnected dams. We propose a systematic representation of watersheds by a network of different connection points, which is the basis for an efficient Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. The model is designed to be adaptable to different connections between dams in both main and tributary rivers. It supports decisions on power generation, pumping and water discharge, maximising profit, and considering realistic constraints on water use and factors such as future energy prices and weather conditions. A relax-and-fix heuristic is proposed to solve the model, along with two heuristic variants to accommodate different watershed structures and sizes. Methodological tests with simulated instances validate their performance, with both variants achieving results within 1% of the optimal solution faster than the model for the tested instances. To evaluate the performance of the approaches in a real-world scenario, we analyse the case study of the Cávado watershed (Portugal), providing relevant insights for managing dam operations. The model generally follows the actual decisions made in typical situations and flood scenarios. However, in the case of droughts, it tends to be more conservative, saving water unless necessary or profitable. The model can be used in a decision-support system to provide decision-makers with an integrated view of the entire watershed and optimised solutions to the operational problem at hand. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Solar energy is highly unstable. Total photovoltaic energy generated varies based on changes in weather, climate and seasons. Owing to the arbitrariness of solar energy, photovoltaic output is prone to frequent power oscillations. Due to this reason, photovoltaic power prediction becomes obligatory. Through comprehensive analysis and critical examination, this research endeavours to shed light on the pursuit with regard to embracing solar energy as a sustainable channel of power generation. Additionally, the study aligns with the United Nations' commitment on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The objective of this study is to prognosticate the electricity output from photovoltaic panel through compilation of meteorological parameters and computation of hourly global solar radiation upon an inclined surface, alongside the resultant energy yield from an inclined photovoltaic panel. This prediction is executed through the deployment of four optimized machine learning methods, specifically Support Vector Machines, Ensemble of Trees, Gaussian Process Regression and Neural Networks. Bayesian Optimization is utilized to optimize the machine learning models by tuning its hyperparameters. The analysis is conducted across three distinct dataset classifications: annual, monthly and seasonal. The empirical findings underscore that optimized Ensemble of Trees exhibits superior performance across all dataset classifications and also necessitates shortest training duration compared to its counterparts.  © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - This study explores the integration and optimization of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) and hydrogen energy storage systems (HESSs) within an energy management system (EMS), using Kangwon National University’s Samcheok campus as a case study. This research focuses on designing BESSs and HESSs with specific technical specifications, such as energy capacities and power ratings, and their integration into the EMS. By employing MATLAB-based simulations, this study analyzes energy dynamics, grid interactions, and load management strategies under various operational scenarios. Real-time data from the campus are utilized to examine energy consumption, renewable energy generation, grid power fluctuations, and pricing dynamics, providing key insights for system optimization. This study finds that a BESS manages energy fluctuations between 0.5 kWh and 3.7 kWh over a 24 h period, with battery power remaining close to 4 W for extended periods. Grid power fluctuates between −5 kW and 75 kW, while grid prices range from 75 to 120 USD/kWh, peaking at 111 USD/kWh. Hydrogen energy storage varies from 1 kWh to 8 kWh, with hydrogen power ranging from −40 kW to 40 kW. Load management keeps power stable at around 35 kW, and PV power integration peaks at 48 kW by the 10th h. The findings highlight that BESSs and HESSs effectively manage energy distribution and storage, improving system efficiency, reducing energy costs by approximately 15%, and enhancing grid stability by 20%. This study underscores the potential of BESSs and HESSs in stabilizing grid operations and integrating renewable energy. Future directions include advancements in storage technologies, enhanced EMS capabilities through artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the development of smart grid infrastructures. Policy recommendations stress the importance of regulatory support and stakeholder collaboration to drive innovation and scale deployment, ensuring a sustainable energy future. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This paper describes a decentralised smart grid system containing renewable energies, storage systems and distributed generation with human control and intervention. The importance of each element and the interaction between them leads to think about a decision-making strategy. In fact, the integration of a Photovoltaic Panel (PVP) is used due to its availability and its participation in the carbon emissions reduction. Also, a battery is required to fill a power gap or absorb extra generated energy. Moreover, an optimal sizing is needed to get an efficient system with minimum cost. Also, an energy management strategy (EMS) is essential to ensure the power resources scheduling in order to keep a continuous equilibrium supply-demand of electricity and avoid instabilities in the grid, with guaranteeing a minimum cost of electricity. In the first part, the proposed smart grid optimal sizing is determined under real weather data (solar radiation) of the city of Sousse, Tunisia, using the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software technique. This approach is chosen thanks to its simplicity, effectiveness, and high precision compared to traditional techniques. In this paper, several configurations (Grid, (Grid-battery), (Grid-PVP), (Grid-PVP-battery)) are studied. The obtained results prove that the (Grid-PVP-battery) system configuration is the most efficient and economical solution. In the second part, a robust energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed for two smart grid configurations (grid-battery, grid-PVP-battery). This strategy is based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) thanks to its non-linear modelling and its ability to make decisions relating to energy management. The primary goal of the suggested (EMS) is to ensure the energy resources scheduling in order to keep a continuous equilibrium among the production and consumption of electricity and avoid instabilities in the grid, with guaranteeing a minimum cost of electricity. As input data, (FLC) used time-varying price electricity (Price (t)) to solve an instant decision problem by choosing, at each instant, the optimal energy source (which provide electricity at the cheapest price possible). The obtained results, carrying out Matlab simulation, prove the efficacy of the proposed strategy, not only, in the energy resources scheduling to meet the load, but also, for the system cost reduction since the PVP has been used as much as possible since it is inexpensive relative to the costs of battery capacity and the grid. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - District energy systems through fourth and fifth generations have shown great promises to help integrate renewable energy sources at large scale and to decarbonize the built environment. However, older generations using boilers represent a large proportion of systems currently in operation, and significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, operational data has become increasingly available for these older generation systems and represents a suitable opportunity for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based modelling and advanced controls. In this context, model predictive control (MPC) has appeared as a powerful control solution; however, field implementation remains relatively scarce. This paper aims to develop an AI-based MPC strategy for multi-boiler district heating systems. It relies on heating load forecasting machine learning models and data-driven boiler performance curves to optimize boiler thermal outputs. This strategy was implemented in two Canadian demonstration sites and showed GHG emissions reductions of 1.3 % and 2.8 %. Although relatively modest, statistical analysis confirmed the realization of these savings. In absolute terms, the strategy helped avoid 45 t and 77 t CO2eq emissions and save $10,268 and $19,975 CAD during the testing period of 2–3 months. The model and strategy developed in this work could be easily scalable to similar district heating systems. © 2023

AB  - Advances and fast development in emerging digital technologies trigger the next generation revolution in energy areas and smart cities, while roles and mechanisms of digital technologies for smart and sustainable transition is unclear. Furthermore, energy flexibility enhancement in intermittent renewable-stochastic demand power management and survival capability in minimizing frequency of power outrage are still not clear, when suffering from climate change and extreme events with emerging digital technologies. In this study, advances in emerging digital technologies have been systematically and comprehensively reviewed, in terms of current development status and mechanisms for energy efficiency and energy integration in energy-efficient systems. Afterwards, roles of energy digitalization technologies are provided for high-efficiency, low-carbon and intelligent building energy systems, including artificial intelligence for dynamic performance predictions, advanced model predictive controls and optimisations of nonlinear systems (e.g., PVs, heat pumps, heat recovery systems and multi-energy storages). Furthermore, digital twin-based building energy digitalization technologies are applied for 3D modeling, monitoring, real-time visualization and virtual reality interaction. Frontier multi-agent based distributed energy systems are comprehensively proposed with multi-agent energy management, including RE-battery-building-EV, RE-building-hydrogen vehicles, and both centralised and distributed energy management systems. Considering the multi-energy system capability for power management (intermittent renewable energy and energy demands) and survival capability when suffering from high-impact and low-probability events, both energy flexibility and energy resilience with energy digitalization technologies are interconnected, for climate change adaption and internet of energy. This study provides a systematic and comprehensive review on emerging digital technologies for energy efficiency and energy integration in smart cities, providing guidelines on sustainable and smart transitions with multi-agent based distributed energy management and energy digitalization technologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Microgrids (MG) in integration with distributed energy resources (DERs) are one of the key models for resolving the current energy problem by offering sustainable and clean electricity. This research presents a novel approach to address the complex challenges of optimizing a DERs based microgrid while considering multiple objectives. In this paper, the utilization of a popular machine learning algorithm, random forest (RF) model is proposed to optimize the DERs based MG configuration. The research commences by collecting historical data on energy consumption, renewable energy production, electricity prices, weather conditions, and other relevant factors of Bengaluru City (Karnataka, India) for different seasons. This research covers the conflicting objectives by finding optimal seasonal sizing of the battery, minimum generation cost, and reduction in battery charging cost. The optimization and analysis are done using an ensemble learningbased RF model. The findings from the RF model are compared with metaheuristics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and artificial neural networks (ANN) for different seasons, i.e., winter, spring and autumn, summer, and monsoon. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - The variability of renewable energy within microgrids (MGs) necessitates the smoothing of power fluctuations through the effective scheduling of internal power equipment. Otherwise, significant power variations on the tie-line connecting the MG to the main power grid could occur. This study introduces an innovative scheduling strategy that utilizes a data-driven approach, employing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to achieve this smoothing effect. The strategy prioritizes the scheduling of MG's internal power devices, taking into account the stochastic charging patterns of electric vehicles. The scheduling optimization model is initially described as a Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing power fluctuations on the interconnection lines and operational costs of the MG. Subsequently, after preprocessing the historical operational data of the MG, an enhanced scheduling strategy is developed through a neural network learning process. Finally, the results from four scheduling scenarios demonstrate the significant impact of the proposed strategy. Comparisons of reward curves before and after data preprocessing underscore its importance. In contrast to optimization results from deep deterministic policy gradient, soft actor-critic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms, the superiority of the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm with the addition of a priority experience replay mechanism is highlighted. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - With the intensification of global climate change, low-carbon energy has become a hot topic, and governments around the world are implementing corresponding policies to promote its use. This research first establishes a Multi-universe Quantum Harmony Search-Algorithm Dynamic Fuzzy System Ensemble (MUQHS-DMFSE) composite model for carbon emission prediction. This model combines the MUQHS algorithm with the DMFSE method by designing the workflow of the MUQHS algorithm, creating a DMFSE composite prediction model, introducing a sliding factor matrix, and using the MUQHS algorithm to search for the optimal sliding factors, thus obtaining optimized prediction values. In the research on low-carbon economic development, the research applies the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method and establishes Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) and Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC) models to assess the technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency, and scale efficiency of decision-making units. This research also uses the BCC model to project the production frontier and calculate input redundancy and output gap rates, and evaluate low-carbon economic development. Through the establishment and application of these two models, the research achieves carbon emission prediction and low-carbon economic analysis, validating the feasibility of the research methodology. The results show that the composite model can effectively predict carbon emissions, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below 3.5% and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) below 200 tons, demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of the model. The research on low-carbon economic development in S Province based on the DEA method reveals the need for energy structure adjustment, clean and renewable energy promotion, control of carbon emissions, and optimization of industrial structure with a focus on developing the tertiary industry. Therefore, the use of artificial intelligence and big data analysis can provide more precise insights into the trends and patterns of low-carbon economic development, as well as more effective predictions of future energy demand and resource supply, offering high practical value and scientific significance.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid advancement of Building-Integrated Hybrid Energy Systems (BIHES), characterized by renewable energy sources with variable generation patterns, presents significant challenges for effective integration and utilization. This paper introduces an optimal economic dispatch strategy for commercial BIHES using a Niche-Ant Colony Optimization (NACO) Algorithm. BIHES integrates renewable sources such as 200 kW photovoltaic panels, 150 kW wind turbines, and 500 kWh energy storage systems within commercial buildings. A detailed mathematical model for economic dispatch leverages a multi-load demand of 1.2 MW and flexible adjustment capabilities. The model aims to maximize on-site renewable energy use while balancing grid interaction. The NACO Algorithm, tested through comprehensive simulations, demonstrated significant improvements, resulting in a 12.96 % reduction in environmental costs, an 18.4 % reduction in the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), and a 14.25 % reduction in total operational costs compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the system achieved annual CO2 savings of 25,000 tons, increased renewable energy absorption by 22 %, reduced grid dependency by 30 %, and decreased energy purchase costs by 20 %. Energy storage optimization also extended the storage system's lifecycle by 15 %. These results highlight the enhanced synergy and complementarity of multiple energy sources within BIHES, showcasing its potential for substantial economic and environmental benefits. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Complex, non-linear systems with diverse consumption, generation, and storage technologies require advanced energy management by considering several factors: resource availability, energy efficiency, economic viability, consumption costs, and installation feasibility. To address these challenges, this paper integrates artificial intelligence into a real grid-connected household with photovoltaic systems, consumption curves, and a potential storage system applying demand response. The first approach incorporates neural networks for generation prediction and genetic algorithms for demand optimization. The second approach integrates optimization and storage, significantly contributing to the feasibility study of storage implementation post-initial optimization; combining such technologies, the synergy between demand-side optimization and energy storage is evaluated by employing commonly used scientific tools, such as MATLAB for modeling and applying artificial intelligence and HOMER for economic analysis. The methodology and results show these approaches' achievements since few studies comprehensively address household power management, considering aspects to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. Results show minimum nRMSEs in the forecast of 8.80, together with regression values up to 0.99594. The study reports cost reductions of up to 69 % and 100 % in worst-case periods for systems without and with batteries, respectively; additionally, it reports increasing self-consumption of renewables by 76 % and 99 %, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The increasing demand for electrical energy is a result of advancing technologies and changing lifestyles worldwide. Meeting this escalating energy need poses a substantial challenge, especially the difficulty in constructing new conventional power plants due to limited fossil fuel resources. To address this, demand-side management (DSM) in smart grid (SG), integrated with solar photovoltaic energy (SPE) have emerged as a crucial tool for effectively managing electricity demand, ensuring flexibility and reliability. DSM achieves optimal electricity utilization by rescheduling the operation schedules of consumer appliances and carefully adjusting their demand profiles. Integrating DSM into a smart grid framework is highly advantageous for the power industry’s pursuit of sustainable energy goals. While various heuristic-based optimization techniques have been employed for DSM, the focus on SPE has been limited to small-scale residential loads. This study utilizes the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to tackle a day ahead DSM minimization problem, considering SPE in areas with large number of appliances. The DSM minimization problem falls into the category of discrete combinatorial problems, making it well-suited for ACO optimization. The self-healing, self-protection, and self-organizing attributes of ACO make it particularly effective for DSM solutions. Residential, commercial, and industrial loads, with and without SPE integration, are considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ACO algorithm. Simulation results are compared with other studies in the literature, including Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Moth Flame Optimization (MFO), and Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO), in terms of reducing consumer’s cost of energy (CCE) and utility peak load (UPL). The findings indicate that the proposed ACO algorithm outperforms the other algorithms considered in the current context. © 2024 – IOS Press.

AB  - Microgrid cost management is a significant difficulty because the energy generated by microgrids is typically derived from a variety of renewable and non-renewable sources. Furthermore, in order to meet the requirements of freed energy markets and secure load demand, a link between the microgrid and the national grid is always preferred. For all of these reasons, in order to minimize operating expenses, it is imperative to design a smart energy management unit to regulate various energy resources inside the microgrid. In this study, a smart unit idea for multi-source microgrid operation and cost management is presented. The proposed unit utilizes the Improved Artificial Rabbits Optimization Algorithm (IAROA) which is used to optimize the cost of operation based on current load demand, energy prices and generation capacities. Also, a comparison between the optimization outcomes obtained results is implemented using Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). The results prove the applicability and feasibility of the proposed method for the demand management system in SMG. The price after applying HBA is 6244.5783 (ID). But after applying the Whale Optimization Algorithm, the cost is found 4283.9755 (ID), and after applying the Artificial Rabbits Optimization Algorithm, the cost is found 1227.4482 (ID). By comparing the proposed method with conventional method, the whale optimization algorithm saved 31.396 % per day, and the proposed artificial rabbit's optimization algorithm saved 80.3437 % per day. From the obtained results the proposed algorithm gives superior performance. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Our study aims to conduct a thorough investigation into the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-based maximum power point tracking control techniques in light of the growing interest in applying artificial intelligence methodologies to renewable energy systems, with a specific focus on photovoltaic systems. This study specifically examines the performance of three well-known artificial intelligence techniques under various climatic conditions: the fuzzy logic controller, the artificial neural network, and the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system. The main goal is to identify the most intelligent strategy that will maximize the power production of solar panels. In the first stage of our inquiry, we compare several artificial neural network configurations and three reliable training methods to examine the training performance of this methodology. It is important to note that setting up the artificial neural network model with a hidden layer of 13 neurons produces impressive results and demonstrates improved convergence. This system achieves a fitness function value of 3.9935E-14 in only 128 epochs, demonstrating its effectiveness and speed in contrast to other architectures. Then, using simulations, we evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the aforementioned artificial intelligence algorithms in order to determine the best strategy for locating the maximum power point in the presence of partial shading. The results highlight the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system strategy’s extraordinary capacity to monitor the maximum power point quickly while demonstrating energy efficiency comparable to the artificial neural network-based bayesian regularization algorithm’s recommended level. We use computational fluid dynamics simulations in the MATLAB®environment to thoroughly assess the proposed approaches. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - The increasing drive towards eco-friendly environment motivates the generation of energy from renewable energy sources (RESs). The rising share of RESs in power generation poses potential challenges, including uncertainties in generation output, frequency fluctuations, and insufficient voltage regulation capabilities. As a solution to these challenges, energy storage systems (ESSs) play a crucial role in storing and releasing power as needed. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) provide significant potential to maximize the energy efficiency of a distribution network and the benefits of different stakeholders. This can be achieved through optimizing placement, sizing, charge/discharge scheduling, and control, all of which contribute to enhancing the overall performance of the network. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of BESS operation, optimization, and modeling in different applications, and how mathematical and artificial intelligence (AI)-based optimization techniques contribute to BESS charging and discharging scheduling. We also discuss some potential future opportunities and challenges of the BESS operation, AI in BESSs, and how emerging technologies, such as internet of things, AI, and big data impact the development of BESSs. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper considers two pertinent research inquiries: ‘Can an AI-based predictive framework be utilised for the optimisation of solar energy management?’ and ‘What are the ways in which the AI-based predictive framework can be integrated within the Smart Grid infrastructure to improve grid reliability and efficiency?’ The study deploys a Deep Learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory techniques, leading to refined accuracy in solar electricity generation forecasts. Such an AI-supported methodology aids power grid operators in comprehensive planning, thereby ensuring a robust electricity supply. The effectiveness of this framework is tested using performance metrics such as MAE, RMSE, nMAE, nRMSE, and (Formula presented.). A persistent model is utilised as a reference for comparison. Despite a slight decrease in predictive precision with the expansion of the forecast horizon, the proposed AI-based framework consistently surpasses the persistent model, particularly for horizons beyond two hours. Therefore, this research underscores the potential of AI-based prediction in fostering efficient solar energy management and enhancing Smart Grid reliability and efficiency. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal hold significant promise for desalination, particularly in remote regions where access to conventional power sources may be limited. These renewable sources are often integrated with desalination methods like reverse osmosis or multi-stage flash to harness their energy potential. While certain combinations demonstrate reliability and cost-effectiveness, the intermittent nature of renewable energy poses challenges in system design, requiring innovative strategies such as combining solar and wind with battery storage or fuel cells. However, determining the optimal configuration for such integrated systems remains challenging using traditional methods due to the complex and dynamic nature of renewable energy resources. In this study, we focus on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in improving the effectiveness and dependability of renewable-powered desalination systems. Specifically, we explore how AI, through techniques like forecasting models, optimization algorithms, and advanced control systems, can enhance the efficiency and sustainability of these systems. Our research delves into how AI-driven solutions can revolutionize the design, operation, and management of renewable-powered desalination plants. By integrating AI in forecasting, optimization, and control techniques, we aim to address challenges associated with renewable energy integration, ultimately paving the way for more efficient and sustainable water desalination processes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - In this article, an artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based smart energy management system (SEMS) is implemented for optimal autonomous microgrid economic operation. The main objective of this study is to increase the reliability of the isolated microgrid and minimize the operating cost. The proposed system is prototyped using an Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE6 FPGA development kit, which is an extremely flexible and reprogrammable logic device. The results were taken for four continuous hours to clarify the reliability of the model. The results show that the SEMS has achieved high performance, a reliable and affordable energy supply, and a quick response to unexpected changes in the loads or power produced. In addition, the use of optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency of the FPGA makes the microgrid more attractive as it increases its flexibility, controllability, and ability to efficiently manage energy while reducing the overall cost. It succeeds in minimizing operating costs by 26.43% compared to the experimental case that did not utilize optimization techniques. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Uncertainties in a microgrid (MG) result in challenges in reaching the optimal production-consumption balance via the energy management system (EMS). Therefore, multi-MG systems are proposed to achieve more optimality with stability. However, the EMS yet faces more uncertainties due to the increased number of renewable energy resources in multi-microgrids. Therefore, the use of a battery energy storage system (BESS) is crucial to manage these uncertainties. BESSs impose huge investment and operation costs, so it is important to consider their optimal planning and operation to maximize their benefits and lifespan. Model-based optimization approaches are used by formulating the EMS problem based on the complete system models under uncertainties. However, this assumption is usually impractical due to the prohibitive complexity and computational burden of solving a large nonlinear problem with many uncertain variables subject to privacy policies. This paper employs the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique to handle uncertainties associated with the large number of uncertain variables in EMS for multi-MG systems. An auxiliary cloud-fog computing framework is proposed for the DRL agents, which includes sufficient storage space, computational resources, and communication infrastructure among MGs. Simulation results in Matlab reveal that the optimality of the EMS is improved by 15 % on average by utilizing the auxiliary computing framework. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Recent advances in artificial intelligence-generated configurations (AIGC) have transformed various fields in science and technology domains and enabled the inverse design of materials and structures for enhanced performance with minimal human input. The patterned micro-/nanostructures are widely adopted to increase power conversion efficiencies in thin-film organic solar cells (OSCs), making these structures highly suitable for AIGC applications. Although the computational cost of traditional numerical simulations is a barrier to making AIGC high throughput, this issue is addressed by integrating the high-speed automated machine learning (AutoML) Analyzer with genetic algorithm-based topology optimization algorithms. Compared to standard numerical solutions, the AutoML Analyzer in the proposed system predicts outcomes ≈22 700 times faster, resulting in a 98.47% reduction in computation costs, while maintaining high average accuracies of ≈99%. By evaluating an extensive dataset of 600 000 AIGCs, an optimized PM6:Y6 OSC device design with a power conversion efficiency of 17.58% is identified, significantly outperforming the 14.70% baseline efficiency of the OSC device without the poly methyl methacrylate scattering and substrate layers. Results underscore the potential of AIGC techniques for efficiently enhancing the performance of photovoltaic devices in renewable energy applications. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - This study aims to perform fast fault diagnosis and intelligent protection in an active distribution network (ADN) with high renewable energy penetration. Several time-domain simulations are carried out in EMTP-RV to extract time-synchronized current and voltage data. The Stockwell transform (ST) was used in MATLAB/SIMULINK to preprocess these input datasets to train the adaptive fault diagnosis deep convolutional neural network (AFDDCNN) for fault location identification, fault type identification, and fault phase-detection for different penetration levels. Based on the AFDDCNN output, the intelligent protection scheme (IDOCPS) generates the signal for isolating a faulty section of the ADN. An intelligent fault diagnosis scheme that combines ST and deep learning methods aids the artificial intelligence-based protection scheme in isolating the faulty section. This study uses the PyTorch framework to build both the AFDDCNN and IDOCPS. The proposed protection technique classifies and isolates faults and coordinates protection with minimum operating time in the IEEE 13-bus ADN. It consistently gives high accuracy for fault diagnosis and minimum operating time for the IDOCPS even when the network’s topology is modified to the IEEE 34-bus ADN. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is more accurate and provides faster fault diagnosis and isolation than state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Turkiye Klinikleri.

AB  - Data centers have been experiencing increasingly significant challenges in electricity consumption and carbon emissions with the fast-development of artificial intelligence (AI). In the context of carbon neutrality, the integration of data centers with renewable green energy has become a prevailing trend. To effectively integrate renewable energy, it is imperative to thoroughly explore the data center's operation flexibility. Delay-tolerant computational workloads have been considered as one of the most promising flexible resources for power regulation within data center micro-grids (DCMs). This paper first analyzes the working characteristics of three kinds of typical delay-tolerant computing workloads, i.e. short-running deferrable workloads, long-running continuous workload, long-running interruptible workload, and then clarifies the time-shifting mechanisms for each. Next, the corresponding time-shifting models of the delay-tolerant workloads are established. Finally, considering the time attributes of workloads and system settings, the day-ahead optimization scheduling framework of DCM incorporating the time-shifting models of multiple workloads are formulated, with the aim of minimizing the operation cost of DCM and renewable power curtailment. Application of the power management scheme in a data center case study confirms its effectiveness in improving the operational economy of data center and increasing green energy utilization.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This study conducts an evaluation of an integrated power, heat, and cooling system reliant on geothermal energy. The process involves integrating both the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and the Goswami cycle. The main objective of this investigation is to analyze the effects of different variables on the system's operation. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis is undertaken to examine how the presence of operational fluids in the ORC affects the overall efficiency of the system. Subsequently, an in-depth economic evaluation is conducted, taking into account the initial investment for system implementation, operational capital, and the levelized cost of goods. The calculation process involves determining the system's income, cash flow, and pay-back time, which heavily rely on the selling prices of the products. By utilizing a genetic algorithm in conjunction with an artificial intelligence algorithm, the system can be optimized to minimize pay-back time and levelized cost of energy, while simultaneously maximizing net production power. The results of this optimization process are then compared with the baseline state of the system to assess the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements. The multifaceted approach enables the evaluation of the system's performance across different conditions and facilitates the optimization of its parameters to improve efficiency and economic feasibility. The comparative optimization results demonstrated a 21 % reduction in payback time, a 14 % increase in net power, and a 12 % improvement in cooling when compared to the reference system state. The payback periods for different operating fluids ranged from 10 to 15 years. Isobutane demonstrated the shortest payback period of approximately 10 years, which was further optimized to 8.6 years. The system demonstrated a power output of 655.8 kW, a cooling output of 578.3 kW, and a heat output of 3042 kW. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Due to their minimal environmental impact, green energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels are increasingly utilized in power systems. However, the power they generate is highly variable, leading to unpredictable fluctuations in power supply. Additionally, advanced smart functions in consumer devices and their unpredictable usage patterns contribute to similar fluctuations in power consumption. These fluctuations present a significant challenge to the stability and quality of the power grid, creating a complex issue of power imbalance that becomes harder to manage. Innovative management and control approaches are necessary to address these challenges and thus support the shift to sustainable energy sources. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly proposed as promising solutions, albeit mostly implemented as isolated solutions within centralized power control systems. To effectively manage the complex and often large scale power systems, this paper advocates the use of a Distributed AI (DAI) framework as imperative in enhancing their agility and stability. An illustrative Nano-Grid example (including the potential use of battery sources in extreme scenarios) is adopted to demonstrate the framework's utility, and a number of power control strategies to safeguard the power system against the variability of both power generators and loads are theoretically formulated and then realized within the proposed framework. Linear Programming, Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization techniques are experimented with, and through simulations, the utility of the DAI framework is demonstrated. The findings underscore the effectiveness and potential benefits of the proposed framework in ensuring the safe and effective operation of power systems with the use of particle swarm optimization amid fluctuating energy scenarios with a small to large number of devices in the nano-grid.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In Industry 5.0, predicting electric vehicle energy usage enhances efficiency and sustainability, optimizes charging infrastructure, and meets consumer demands. Leveraging IoT, AI, and analytics enables smart charging that aligns with renewable energy goals, addresses infrastructure limitations, and promotes sustainable transportation by improving user experience, cutting costs, and boosting trust in electric vehicles. This research aims to create a synthetic data set for electric vehicles using an enhanced Generative adversarial network model and, from that, predict the energy for charging electric vehicles using ensemble Machine Learning algorithms. The importance of more detailed features for the best-performing machine learning model has been done utilizing Explainable Artificial Intelligence, specifically, the Shapley Additive Explanations approach, to provide more understanding and derive the inter-dependency among features. The enhanced TemporalCharge Generative adversarial network model provides Skewness and Kurtosis values as -0.51 and -0.182, respectively, for synthetically generated data for the city of Berhampur, Odisha, India, which is very close to four-wheeler electric vehicle charging data of the city. Several plots illustrate the influence of key features on electric vehicle energy consumption during charging, which enhances user optimization, owner empowerment, and ecosystem sustainability.

AB  - This study focuses on the implementation of an efficient hybrid power system in two main phases. Firstly, it aims to optimize the performance of individual renewable energy sources (RESs), ensuring their maximum efficiency. Secondly, it employs artificial intelligence to enhance energy flow within the microgrid. The primary focus is on ensuring the reliability, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of microgrid operations. In the first phase, the system focuses on optimizing power generation from PV and wind turbines (WTs). To maximize power extraction from the PV system, the study utilizes turbulent flow of water-based optimization (TFWO) and gorilla troops optimizer (GTO) algorithms. An advanced hybrid TFWO-ANFIS and hybrid GTO-ANFIS-based MPPT techniques are proposed, enhancing energy capture efficiency. These advanced MPPT techniques combine the adaptability of ANFIS with the optimization capabilities of metaheuristic algorithms, resulting in improved energy capture efficiency. Additionally, the system improves the performance of WTs by implementing the Zero d-axis current (ZDC) strategy. The second phase focuses on efficient energy storage and utilization of backup systems. It uses optimization algorithms to manage battery charging, hydrogen production, and the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) approach. The outcomes of the proposed study showcase optimized backup system operation, resulting in cost savings and increased utilization of RESs. The proposed system is comprehensively assessed across diverse operational scenarios. Four different cases are presented, each differing in the degree of involvement of backup sources. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in managing power generation and load demand, ensuring optimal system performance. A comparative analysis of two algorithms is conducted, utilizing a set of 9 benchmark test functions. The results of this analysis highlight the superior speed and accuracy of TFWO in reaching the best solution. TFWO exhibited a faster convergence rate towards the optimal solution. The optimization algorithms succeed in reducing the operating cost significantly, notably reaching a 4.05 % reduction in the third scenario. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) are essential to the modernization of transportation systems. However, optimizing EV charging to align with grid stability and renewable energy availability remains a challenge. To address this challenge, this study introduces a machine learning-based framework to optimize EV charging by considering driver satisfaction - a novel approach quantifying this multidimensional construct through socio-demographic attributes, State of Charge (SoC), proximity to charging stations, and variable charging fees. Driver satisfaction is defined as the extent to which the EV charging experience aligns with drivers' expectations, integrating these key factors to influence decision-making and overall happiness with the charging service. Trained on a dataset from Hungarian EV users, the developed model predicts outcomes with high accuracy (87.9%), leading to an optimization algorithm that maximizes driver satisfaction while minimizing grid power purchase costs. Our results from a simulated smart grid demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an average charging satisfaction score of 98.5% compared to 69.54% from a traditional method. Additionally, the proposed method maintained the SoC of the EV fleet at a stable average around 50%, optimizing energy use and grid stability. By dynamically assigning EVs to charging stations and leveraging photovoltaic sources, our solution not only boosts driver satisfaction but also aids in the sustainable growth of smart grids. This research marks a significant step forward in the smart management of EV charging by introducing a driver-centric optimization model, filling a critical gap in current literature and offering insights into its application in enhancing urban mobility solutions. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Education's evolution in the context of energy systems is essential for addressing sustainable energy challenges and developing a workforce equipped for future innovations, emphasizing both formal curricula and informal lifelong learning through successful energy case studies. As the global energy sector transforms to reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels, innovations in renewable technologies like solar thermal are pivotal for promoting energy security and economic stability, supported by an educational foundation that fosters awareness and technical skills for sustainable development. Exposure to successful renewable energy systems, such as solar-powered refrigeration, offers an informal educational experience that enhances understanding and supports global educational goals, initiating with the innovative design and optimization of these systems using artificial intelligence (neural networks). Based on this formulation, the current article developed two sustainable energy systems by comparing the refrigeration cycles with two different operating fluids and various arrangements, and multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary genetic algorithm is performed for the proposed systems. The studied systems are refrigeration cycles using an ejector and without an ejector with two working fluids of lithium bromide and lithium chloride. The present work's main aim is to examine the working fluid and refrigeration system arrangements. Energy and economic modeling were performed for the proposed systems, and then parametric analysis and two-objective optimization were extracted. Parameters such as generator temperature, condenser temperature, absorber temperature, and evaporator temperature, which significantly impact the proposed system's performance, have been selected as decision parameters, and parametric analysis has been extracted for them. In addition to the mentioned parameters, diffusion mixing efficiency, nozzle efficiency, and heat exchanger have also been studied in the ejector asset system. To find the best values of decision variables, multi-objective optimization for both arrangements is conducted, and results are presented. The results have indicated that the refrigeration system using lithium chloride working fluid without an ejector achieves a coefficient of performance of 0.766 and a cost of 0.922 $/h at the optimal point, while the system with an ejector yields a higher coefficient of performance (1.047) and a slightly lower cost rate (0.991 $/h). The outcomes of this work can play a critical role for higher education institutions in advancing innovative solutions to pressing energy challenges. Lifelong learning, at the heart of educational innovation, can benefit from the integration of sustainable energy systems as a core component of informal education through the optimization of ejector refrigeration systems. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The use of machine learning algorithms for the control of schedulable loads like Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), illumination, dryers and irrigation systems to optimize the use of RES and increase energy saving has obtained remarkable results in the last years. However, in the residential sector of tropical countries where HVAC systems are not necessary, these loads represent only a small percentage of the total energy consumption. In order to achieve a significant impact on energy savings and promote the use of RES, other residential loads must be taken into account in tropical countries. In the case of Colombia, for example, fridges account for 24% of residential energy consumption. This research proposes the use of RL for the development of a fridge energy management system capable of minimizing energy consumption and optimizing the use of RES for cooling. The fridge energy management system is based on an RL agent to control the fridge, and an artificial neural network to model the environment and assess the impact of its actions. Compared to the original fridge control, the RL-based control successfully reduced the total energy usage by 23% while also increasing the use of RES energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - — The dual active bridge (DAB) converter is the key enabler in many popular applications, such as wireless charging, electric vehicle, and renewable energy. ZVS range and efficiency are two significant performance indicators for the DAB converter. To obtain the desired ZVS and efficiency performance, modulation should be carefully designed. Hybrid modulation (HM) considers several single modulation strategies to achieve good comprehensive performance. Conventionally, to design an HM, a harmonic approach or piecewise approach is used, but they suffer from a time-consuming model-building process and inaccuracy. Therefore, an artificial-intelligence-based hybrid extended phase shift (HEPS) modulation is proposed. Generally, the HEPS modulation is developed in an automated fashion, which alleviates the cumbersome model-building process while keeping high model accuracy. In HEPS modulation, two EPS strategies are considered to realize optimal efficiency with full ZVS operation over entire operating ranges. Specifically, to build data-driven models of ZVS and efficiency performance, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), which is a state-of-the-art ensemble learning algorithm, is adopted. Afterward, particle swarm optimization with state-based adaptive velocity limit (PSO-SAVL) is utilized to select the best EPS strategy and optimize modulation parameters. With 1-kW hardware experiments, the feasibility of HEPS has been verified, achieving optimal efficiency with a maximum of 97.1% and full-range ZVS operation. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Computational simulation has been used in the semiconductor industry since the 1950s to provide engineers and managers with a faster, more cost-effective method of designing semiconductors. With increased pressure in the semiconductor industry to move towards greener and more sustainable manufacturing, it is crucial to understand the impact of computational simulation and artificial intelligence on environmental sustainability, specifically reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper quantifies the degree to which various types of simulation used for hardware, process, and device optimization can be adopted for different applications in wafer fabrication equipment research and development, along with the potential reduction in physical experimentation, saving silicon, gases, chemicals, and wafers. With this understanding and an estimation of the equivalent carbon cost impact of the computation itself, analyzed projects demonstrated a significant (&#x003E;80%) decrease in emissions, primarily driven by the ability to use fewer patterned and blanket wafers whose carbon footprint appears to be orders of magnitude larger than that of used modeling resources. The paper concludes with an attempt to quantify the environmental savings from virtualization across our entire research organization and to illustrate the potential future impact of described activities.&#x2018; Authors

AB  - Power quality issues, such as abnormal voltage, current, or frequency, can cause equipment malfunctions and failures, resulting in financial losses. With the developing integration of RES into distribution networks through custom power devices like electronic power cassette adapters, there is a need to address the challenge of integrating the variable output of RES into traditional grids. Energy storage systems are a potential solution, but they are costly for RES applications. This study proposes a hybrid solar structure combined with battery energy storage systems (BESS) to optimize power consumption and improve power quality using a meta-heuristic approach. The research methodology involves simulation using real solar PV data. The significance of the proposed approach lies in its potential to enhance power quality while utilizing the maximum capacity of BESS, thereby improving the integration of RES into distribution networks and mitigating financial losses caused by power quality issues. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the coming years, decentralized power generation systems with renewables are expected to take a leading role, and micro gas turbines will serve as backup sources to compensate for times of low inputs from other sources. In order to deal with the unpredictable energy inputs from renewables, the micro gas turbine must be capable of running under varying load conditions and making fast transitions between them. The operation of a micro gas turbine in an integrated microgrid (MG) has the potential to reduce operational costs and ensure the delivery of demanded heat and power to consumers. This paper investigates the operation of a micro gas turbine in a MG, serving as a supplementary power source for a municipal building. The building’s required energy is initially provided by wind turbine power, and the micro gas turbine serves as a backup source during times of wind power deficiency. The micro gas turbine can operate using a natural gas/hydrogen fuel blend ranging from zero to 100% hydrogen. Furthermore, a water electrolyzer with a hydrogen tank is available to operate as a storage system within the MG. The study’s results demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of using hydrogen storage and optimizing operational planning in the MG. The primary objective of the paper is to highlight the feasibility and benefits of employing micro gas turbines and hydrogen storage systems within a MG as a renewable energy backup power source. © 2024 by ASME.

AB  - Considering the electricity market, data analytics paves the way for completely new strategies regarding demand and supply-side policies. In this manner, predictive analysis of the demanded power accuracy is carried out to boost profits and increase the penetration of similar demand response (DR) programs across all levels of end-user categories. Residential loads experience stiff spikes and unpredictable variations due to occupancy activities and environmental factors. To address this, we first propose a robust short-term multivariate-multistep forecasting framework that is resilient to missing or erroneous data, employing temporal convolution networks (TCNs). We then incorporate two distinct valley-filling indices to optimize the charging of electric vehicle loads according to DR requirements, showcasing the efficacy of leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance the utilization of clean energy resources. Simulation studies are conducted using real-world nodal residential loads with hourly granularity. The results demonstrate that the forecasting method is reliable for residential locations, even when dealing with highly damaged data. The case studies effectively fill the load into the valleys and minimize fluctuations in residential locations. Through the integration of emission-aware forecasting and optimization strategies, our study lays the groundwork for a comprehensive approach that not only improves economic outcomes and grid stability but also advances the imperative of reducing carbon emissions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Due to technological advancements, a greater emphasis on renewable energy and the possibility to reduce the impacts of transportation on climate change, air pollution, and other environmental issues are analyzed, which gives rise to artificial intelligence techniques for efficient public transportation systems. However, minimizing energy conception, charging time, and increasing the remaining energy is the main contest for the development of EVs among traditional vehicles. In this research, an optimized scheduling technique named the Smart Decision-Hunting optimization (SDHO) algorithm is proposed for determining the available charging stations. The proposed SDHO-based scheduling scheme is used to determine the optimal CS for charging EVs. The suggested SDHO-based charge scheduling scheme is authenticated by vehicular Adhoc network simulation and attains better performance by considering the maximum number of vehicles. The system paradigm for electric vehicle charge scheduling management aims to select the most relevant charging station that requires the least amount of service time for the EV driver since the search of charging station and the waiting time may cause time delay and energy drain. The SDHO algorithm is based on swarm intelligence-based optimization approaches to start a high-level solution based on the first random population of feasible solutions and their fitness function. The Cervus deer strategy was used to enhance the performance of the electric vehicle charge schedule by using the combined characteristics of the Casanova wolf and the Cervus deer. SDHO-based charging scheduling scheme uses communal grading, bordering, stalking, detecting, and ceasing phases. The fitness function is evaluated by concerning parameters like average waiting time, and minimum distance of charging at a charging station. The proposed SDHO-based Charge scheduling scheme achieves the lowest average waiting time of 0.34 min, charged vehicles of 8, a distance of 27.812 km, and the highest remaining energy of 53.934 w, which shows the highest performance than the existing models.Thus, the proposed method provided better charge scheduling for electric vehicles, which stands as an advantage for E-Vehicle charging stations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study aims to introduce a comprehensive framework for canal modernization, emphasizing the integration of the Archimedes screw turbine as an alternative to traditional drop structures. The goal is to harness renewable energy, improve water distribution efficiency, and address both economic and environmental concerns within canal systems. Our approach employs CROPWAT8 for accurate estimation of crop water requirements and utilizes HEC-RAS for canal simulation. A distinct feature is the integration of fuzzy sarsa learning artificial intelligence within MATLAB. This integration facilitates a seamless operational link between HEC-RAS and fuzzy sarsa systems, optimizing canal operations while enhancing key water distribution indicators such as efficiency, adequacy, and equity. The implementation of our framework led to significant advancements in canal operations. The outcomes included a hydro-module of 0.6 l.s−1.ha−1, and Archimedes Screw Turbine designs with outer diameters varying between 1.17 m to 2.55 m for diverse inline gates. There was a marked enhancement in efficiency (0.993), adequacy (0.997), and equity (0.038) indicators. Additionally, the system exhibited an annual energy output of 219,009 kWh, curbing CO2 emissions by 153,306 kg annually. This translated to an economic gain of $2,146 annually from carbon credits alone. The presented framework not only proves its economic viability, with a payback period of 5.4 years but also demonstrates its environmental benefits. It underscores the immense potential of adopting a holistic approach to canal modernization. Such an approach combines effective agricultural water management with renewable energy generation, encapsulating both economic sustainability and environmental responsibility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The primary objective of the current research is to speed up the shift towards a carbon-neutral economy and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by developing a novel, highly efficient, environmentally friendly, and economically feasible multi-generation system based on solar-biomass hybridization. The essential element of this concept involves the introduction of green hydrogen into the combustion chamber, aiming to enhance the quality of the incineration products and facilitate the implementation of a waste-to-power Rankine cycle. The practicality of the suggested model is compared with a system that does not incorporate hydrogen injection. As a part of artificial intelligence, a neural network model integrated with the grey wolf optimizer is applied to ascertain the most optimal energy conversion/management condition with reduced computational time. The results show that the injection of additional hydrogen exhibits superior performance compared to the base system from all facets. The optimization achieves higher exergy efficiency and drinkable water production of 8.7 % and 27.9 kg/s while reducing the total cost and emission index of 13.7 $/h and 410.7 kg/GWh. The results indicate that the combustion chamber and steam generator are the poorest parts in terms of exergy under ideal conditions. Potential future directions of this work are to explore alternate techniques for generating hydrogen and perform regional evaluations to comprehend the accessibility and fluctuation of biomass and solar resources in various geographical areas. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - The importance of renewable energy resources in the energy province necessitates the use of photovoltaic (PV) and wind systems to power brushless DC (BLDC) motors for applications such as water pumping and automobiles. In this research, an optimized MPPT-based positive output super-lift Luo converter (PO-SLLC) is presented for a hybrid power system with a BLDC motor to overcome the constraints of ordinary DC-DC converters. The Luo converter produces a positive output voltage which aids in achieving a high power density with fewer ripples in the voltage and current profile. The output voltage grows in geometric progression, increasing the converter's efficiency, according to its mathematical model. Adjustment parameter enhanced Aquila optimization (APEAO) is used to optimize the duty cycle of the PO-SLLC from the MPPT controller and the controller parameters of the PI controller of the wind system. The proposed system's behavior for variations in irradiation patterns with constant load torque is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The settling time and overshoot obtained with the proposed optimized controller are compared to those obtained with other optimization controllers, such as ant colony optimization (ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), Aquila optimization (AO), advanced version of harmony search algorithm (2N+1-HSA) and opposition based quantum bat algorithm (OQBA) and it is demonstrated that the proposed APEAO optimized controller has good dynamic performance. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Hydrogen supply chain (HSC) consists of various production, conditioning, transportation, storage, and distribution processes, all of which require extensive computational resources for precise modelling. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a pivotal tool for addressing model-based decision-making challenges, courtesy of its rapid and efficient computational capabilities. This paper proposes a comprehensive HSC model consisting of an economic policy planner, a wholesale hydrogen market, a power supply system, a hydrogen distribution system (HDS), and hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs). It leverages an AI circular hydrogen economist approach based on a hierarchical deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm, offering a new alternative to traditional multi-objective bi-level optimization platforms. The model incorporates green, blue, and gray hydrogen production processes as viable hydrogen production pathways, with the hierarchical MARL's agents representing the HDS and HRSs at two decision-making levels. Energy requirements are met through a combination of on-site renewable energy sources, the main power grid, or distributed power generation systems. Several HSC scenarios are examined with respect to various combinations of green hydrogen supply rates and carbon credits granted to them under optimum conditions. The results showed that the developed hierarchical MARL has the potential to replace mathematical programming (MP), uncovering a new economic-environmental trade-off between profit of HDS and operational costs of HRSs. Notably, green hydrogen transactions exponentially increase within the supply chain as the carbon credits exceed $1 per kilogram of hydrogen. While this research focuses on optimizing daily operations within the HSC, future efforts can aim to extend this optimization to forecasted annual operations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The integrated use of multiple renewable energy sources to increase the efficiency of heat pump systems, such as in Solar Assisted Geothermal Heat Pumps (SAGHP), may lead to significant benefits in terms of increased efficiency and overall system performance especially in extreme climate contexts, but requires careful integrated optimization of the different system components. In particular, thermal storages take a fundamental role in optimizing the integration of renewable energy sources and the system operation. This work investigates the potential design optimization of a SAGHP system in a mountain site by exploring many different alternatives to optimize the mutual relationship between the solar field, the geothermal field and the water thermal storages. This is done through an original simulation-based multi-objective optimization framework considering energy efficiency and economic feasibility, which allows appraising the impact of the different design alternatives on the overall system performance and on the dynamics of the different system components. Results identify a set of optimized system configurations that optimize the integrated exploitation of the different thermal sources showing a potential increase of the overall system performance leading to 34% lower global cost compared to the initial design. High robustness of the optimal design solutions is reported with respect to the current context of high economic uncertainty. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - With integration of large-scale renewable energy, new controllable devices, and required reinforcement of power grids, modern power systems have typical characteristics such as uncertainty, vulnerability and openness, which makes operation and control of power grids face severe security challenges. Application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies represented by machine learning in power grid regulation is limited by reliability, interpretability and generalization ability of complex modeling. Mode of hybrid-Augmented intelligence (HAI) based on human-machine collaboration (HMC) is a pivotal direction for future development of AI technology in this field. Based on characteristics of applications in power grid regulation, this paper discusses system architecture and key technologies of human-machine hybrid-Augmented intelligence (HHI) system for large-scale power grid dispatching and control (PGDC). First, theory and application scenarios of HHI are introduced and analyzed; then physical and functional architectures of HHI system and human-machine collaborative regulation process are proposed. Key technologies are discussed to achieve a thorough integration of human/machine intelligence. Finally, state-of-The-Art and future development of HHI in power grid regulation are summarized, aiming to efficiently improve the intelligent level of power grid regulation in a human-machine interactive and collaborative way.  © 2015 CSEE.

AB  - Renewable energy sources (RES) are natural energy sources that do not deplete with time. These energy sources are characterised as decentralised, modular, flexible technologies, closer to the load, and having smaller production capability. RES suffers from some drawbacks like reliability owing to its intermittent nature and high initial investment costs. To mitigate these drawbacks, hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) are proposed in research studies. Different methodologies that operate these HRES at the optimal with their mathematical modelling, different algorithms (artificial intelligence and meta-heuristic) are reviewed in this paper. According to the literature survey, more researchers are giving attention to adjusting reliability and cost of energy separately or in the combination of both. On the other hand, environmental effects are critical issues for the globe in this century but have not given more attention. Copyright © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Combining artificial intelligence (AI) and optimization techniques in the quest for environmental sustainability has emerged as a promising strategy. This paper explores the potential of a Federated Long Short-Term Memory (Fed LSTM) model in addressing environmental challenges through decentralized learning and efficient intelligence. Fed LSTM, a model tailored for government curricula, offers a novel method for analyzing and optimizing disaggregated environmental data across multiple sites while preserving data privacy. Its applications in environmental sustainability span various domains. Firstly, energy policy enables the creation of accurate local energy consumption forecasting models by integrating data from diverse sources such as buildings, infrastructure, and renewable energy installations. Secondly, in environmental monitoring, Fed LSTM facilitates the quantification of key parameters like biodiversity levels. Thirdly, resource efficiency optimizes the use of resources in agriculture, water management, and waste management, leading to more efficient resource management and reduced environmental impact. The benefits of Fed LSTM have the potential to significantly enhance environmental sustainability by providing adaptive solutions and new options for managing complex environmental challenges through decentralized and privacy-protected approaches. This paper advocates for further research and effective implementation of Fed LSTM in environmental sustainability initiatives to realize its full potential in promoting positive environmental development. With an accuracy of 99.2 %, surpassing existing methods, this approach is implemented using Python. © 2024 The Authors

These meteorological conditions such as solar irradiance, temperature, and wind speed are nonlinear and stochastic, thus affecting the estimation of solar photovoltaic (PV) power. Accurate estimation of photovoltaic power is essential for enhancing the functioning of solar power installations. The paper aims to develop a novel deep learning-based photovoltaic power prediction model on different weather conditions. The proposed model utilises a two-stage deep learning framework for accurate solar PV power prediction, which combines the long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning architectures. The key role of CNN layer is to identify the weather conditions, i.e., sunny, partially cloudy, and extremely cloudy, while the LSTM layer learns the patterns of solar power generation that depend on weather variations to estimate photovoltaic power. The proposed hybrid models consider meteorological factors, such as wind speed, irradiance, temperature, and humidity, including cloud cover and UV index to provide precise solar PV power prediction. The presented hybrid model has better performance metrices having root mean square error of 0.0254, 0.03465, and 0.0824, mean square error of 0.000645, 0.00120, and 0.00679, R2 of 0.9898, 0.9872, and 0.9358, and mean average error of 0.0163, 0.0236, and 0.2521 for sunny, partially cloudy, and extremely cloudy weather conditions, respectively. The results demonstrate that presented deep learning-based novel solar PV power prediction model can accurately predict solar PV power based on instantaneous changes in generated power patterns and aid in the optimisation of PV power plant operations. The paper presents an effective methodology for prediction of solar power that can contribute to the improvement of solar power generation and management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Rapid increase in the usage of intermittent renewable energy, ongoing changes in electrical power system structure and operational needs posing growing problems while ensuring adequate service reliability and retaining the quality of power. Power system reliability is a pertinent factor to consider while planning, designing, and operating distribution systems. utilities are obligated to offer their customers uninterrupted electrical service at the least cost while maintaining a satisfactory level of service quality. The important metrics for gauging the effect of distributed renewable energy on distribution networks is reliability analysis. Reliability analysis in distribution systems involves evaluating the performance and robustness of electrical distribution networks. An artificial intelligence approach is implemented in this paper to improve reliability analysis with dispersed generations in distribution network. Deep belief neural networks (DBNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that can be used for various tasks, including analyzing complex data such as those found in power distribution systems. This paper integrated a DBNN using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The proposed model performance is assessed using mean square error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and R squared error. The findings reveal that reliability analysis with this novel technique is more accurate. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Building integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPV/T) systems offer a highly effective means of generating clean energy for both electricity and heating purposes in residential buildings. Hence, this article introduces a new BIPV/T system to optimally minimize the energy consumption of a household residential building. The meticulous design of the proposed BIPV/T system is accomplished through MATLAB/Simulink® dynamic modeling. Performance analysis for the BIPV/T system is performed under different seasonal conditions with in-depth techno-economic analyses to estimate the expected enhancement in the thermal, electrical, and economic performance of the system. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the impact of various factors on the energetic and economic performances of the proposed BIPV/T system. More so, the two-layer feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network modeling is developed to accurately predict the hourly solar radiation and ambient temperature for the BIPV/T. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization using the NSGA-II method is also conducted for the minimization of the total BIPV/T plant area and maximization of the total efficiency and net thermal power of the system as well as to estimate the optimized operating conditions for input variables across different seasons within the provided ranges. The sensitivity analysis revealed that higher solar flux levels lead to increased electric output power of the BIPV/T plant, but total efficiency decreases due to higher thermal losses. Moreover, the proposed NSGA-II shows a feasible method to attain a maximum net thermal power and optimal total efficiency of 5320 W and 63% with a minimal total plant area of 32.89 m2 that attained a very low deviation index from the ideal solution. The levelised cost of electricity is obtained as 0.10 $/kWh under the optimal conditions. Thus, these findings offer valuable insights into the potential of BIPV/T systems as a sustainable and efficient energy solution for residential applications. © 2024

AB  - The quest for energy independence within urban microgrids (MGs) has become increasingly crucial for ensuring domestic resource utilization and environmental sustainability. One of the pivotal challenges lies in the clustering of MGs, a complex task aimed at enhancing their robustness and economic performance during events. However, limited research has been conducted on this intricate clustering problem. This study addresses this gap by proposing an artificial intelligence-based method tailored for MG clustering. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-objective optimization approach to determine the optimal clustering of standalone MGs. Our methodology considers a range of critical parameters, including distributed generation (DG) droop settings, DG locations and capacities, renewable energy resources from solar units and wind turbines, capacitors, and power transmission lines. By minimizing power losses and enhancing voltage stability, we identify a virtual cut-set line, often referred to as the "virtual line," characterized by minimal power exchange between clustered MGs. To achieve optimal and cost-effective performance, we develop an enhanced differential genetic evolution algorithm designed to address multi-objective problems within stringent constraints. Additionally, we employ Bayesian theory within artificial intelligence to estimate the optimal output power of renewable energy sources, specifically wind turbines and solar panels. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to a 69-bus MG across various scenarios. Our findings demonstrate the proficiency of our method in achieving energy independence, domestic resource utilization, and environmental sustainability within urban microgrids. © 2023

AB  - The implementation of Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) with appropriate energy management can provide consumer units (CUs) with a significant reduction in energy purchase costs and stimulate the use of distributed generation from renewable energy sources, thereby reducing the environmental impact of the energy sector. This study presents a new methodology that integrates meteorological forecasts to estimate renewable energy production through mathematical models and from the day-ahead demands forecast, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is applied to optimize the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) parameters to minimize the total VPPs energy costs. Additionally, a smart contract was written in Solidity and implements user registration, an oracle mechanism to integrate real-world data on-chain, such as Time-of-Use (TOU) prices and feed-in tariffs. An optimization-based profit distribution algorithm is employed to distribute the value generated by the Demand Side Management (DSM) operation among all participants, utilizing Load Factor and a modified Peak-to-Average Ratio. The study case results show a cost reduction of 22.63%, the energy consumption at the peak periods reduced by 48.67%, and 83.53% of the energy exported into the grid, due to the aggregation of the CUs and the BESS implementation. Results from DSM's blockchain-based system have achieved savings for consumer units ranging from 10.41% to 114.80%. The savings of 114.80% represents a nominal profit of 14.80% compared to the previous cost (without DSM). The profit distribution mechanism plays an important role in encouraging consumer units to improve their demand profile in order to maximize the efficiency of the DSM system and consequently obtain financial benefits. Finally, the Deployment costs and operational expenses of the proposed DSM smart contract on various Ethereum-based blockchains are also analyzed, providing insights into the feasibility and scalability of the system. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy management in a renewable energy-based microgrid has a key role in improving energy utilisation and reducing the microgrid operation cost. The optimal energy management strategy can be significantly affected by the intermittency of renewable energies and also harsh weather conditions. In this study, a novel snow conditions-compatible computational intelligence-based short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting (PVPF) approach is proposed that is independent of exogenous weather forecasts. The proposed approach consists of a snow cover detection stage, a snow cover forecasting stage, and a PV power forecasting stage. This approach is then validated for a model predictive control (MPC)-based energy management system (EMS) of a PV energy-based grid-connected microgrid located in a snow-prone area. The PVPF method together with a computational intelligence-based short-term load demand forecasting model constitutes the forecasting block of the EMS. The forecasting block generates day-ahead hourly forecasts based on the local measurements of the meteorological-electrical parameters and sends them to the optimisation block where a two-stage control method, corresponding to the tertiary and secondary control levels, is developed based on mixed-integer linear and quadratic programming. The developed EMS is applied to a test microgrid simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and compared with a heuristic control method. The results show that the proposed approach can reduce the overall operation cost of the microgrid by 8% (24$), 15% (166$), and 13% (235$) on sunny, cloudy, and snowy days under study, respectively, compared to the heuristic controller. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Load corrections with respect to power quality (PQ) after the first pre-estimate of Renewable Energy (RE) power consumption must ensure system-tolerant performance without malfunctions. First, acceptable daily load sequences for the attached equipment are combined and determined according to the RE potential and charge states in accommodation to user needs and normal operation. The main motivation is a consequent day-to-day verification of algorithmically scheduled power consumption tasks in the proposed two-stage optimisation according to the system resources and user needs. Statistical artificial intelligence (AI) is employed, as local atmospheric turbulences with terrain obstacles and unexpected user activity result in various operational states in real microsystems. A new unconventional neurocomputing strategy, called Differential Learning (DfL), was applied in the modelling and prediction of the high dynamical PQ parameters in an experimental RE based system according to input-output training data, without an exact specification of its behaviour. The DfL models were compared with recent deep and machine learning techniques. Prediction models were formed after an initial detection of adequate daily training intervals. The AI models are finally tested to process the complete 24-hour forecast series of related input variables used in learning, to estimate the PQ target output at the corresponding times. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Thoroughly utilizing the first principles of chemical processes, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence algorithms has been a deterministic trend in process modeling technology. However, the complexity of reaction networks triggers austere challenges to the deeper understanding of hybrid modeling techniques. Herein, this study explores a universal framework that integrates artificial intelligence algorithms and process mechanisms. The concept of “transparent AI-assisted chemical processes” is proposed. This study meticulously explains how to build a database integrating process big data and reaction network data. Based on the established machine learning framework incorporating process big data and mechanisms, multi-objective optimization algorithms are combined to achieve process optimization. The results indicate that the comprehensive dimensions of the optimized process's technical performance, economic performance, and environmental impact have energetically upgraded. Compared to the pre-optimization process, the optimized process's conversion rate and high-value product yield have increased by 4.44% and 4.25%, respectively. Moreover, the optimized process's non-renewable energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 6.23% and 12.60%, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article provides a detailed evaluation of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) approaches and metaheuristic algorithms for optimizing wind turbine location inside wind farms. The growing need for renewable energy sources has fueled an increase in research towards efficient and sustainable wind farm designs.

AB  - The major problems in the power system network of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region include the utilization of substantial fossil fuels, which leads to significant emissions of CO2. Moreover, due to the depletion of fossil fuels, it is very difficult to manage the demand requirement of the SAARC regions, which leads to significant power shortage issues. These problems would be resolved through the integration of the substantial amount of renewable energy resources (RERs) that are available in excess in the SAARC regions into the power system networks. This will provide a futuristic roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment in the SAARC region. In this regard, the SAARC region has devised a new plan to transform its smart grid infrastructure into the super smart grid (SSG), which would connect the SAARC countries using the high voltage transmission lines utilizing each country's substantial RERs. To accelerate this ecofriendly effort, the key objective of this review study is to evaluate the potential of the SAARC SSG for demand management and emissions reduction. This study provides a comprehensive overview of SSG technology, covering its technical background, management, power flow improvement techniques, power stability techniques, simulation models, and future steps for development in the SAARC region. First, the regional conflicts, energy deficiency, and potential of the SAARC region have been discussed. Second, a potential architecture of the SAARC SSG has been simulated. Third, a novel Markov chain modeling has been presented for demand management in the SAARC regions. The results and discussions section presents findings from simulations and models. The paper also discusses CO2 reduction techniques, including methods for capturing, storing, and utilizing carbon in biofuel. The study also discusses futuristic optimization techniques in SSG, including blockchain, federated learning, reinforcement learning, the metaverse, digital twin technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. The SSG challenges and limitations section summarizes the challenges and limitations faced by SSG. Finally, a roadmap to a sustainable and green energy environment for the SAARC power grids has been identified to support the implementation of the futuristic SAARC SSG. The results exhibited that there is a good potential for successful demand management and emissions reduction through the SAARC SSG. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Accurate forecasting of solar power generation is crucial for effective management of renewable energy resources. This literature review emphasises the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in predicting solar energy potential. While traditional ANNs with single hidden layers and predefined neuron configurations have shown success in various applications, they are not suitable for predicting nonlinear time-series databases in the context of this research. The limitations of traditional ANNs in predicting solar power potential necessitate the exploration of alternative approaches. Configuring the structure of traditional ANNs for solar power prediction is a time-consuming process that often requires manual or trial-and-error methods. To address this issue, optimisation techniques are incorporated into the ANN model. Various traditional methods have been explored in this research, but none has achieved satisfactory performance. Drawing from experiences with traditional techniques, a novel Evolution of Cub to Predator (ECP) technique is proposed. The investigation results demonstrate that the incorporation of optimisation techniques yields superior performance compared to traditional ANNs. The proposed ECP technique achieves an impressive prediction accuracy of 97.2%, surpassing existing optimisation techniques. These findings highlight the potential of the ECP technique for accurate solar power prediction and its contribution to optimising renewable energy resource management. ©, Engineers Australia.

AB  - The increasing need for effective energy storage solutions has led to the prominence of lithium-ion batteries as a crucial technology across multiple industries. The proficient administration of these batteries is imperative in order to guarantee maximum efficiency, prolong their longevity, and uphold safety measures. This study presents a novel methodology for enhancing battery management systems (BMS) through the integration of cloud-based solutions, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning approaches. In this study, we present a conceptual framework that utilises cloud computing to augment the practical functionalities of battery management systems (BMS) specifically in the context of lithium-ion batteries. The incorporation of cloud computing facilitates the implementation of scalable data storage, remote monitoring, and processing resources, hence enabling the execution of real-time analysis and decision-making processes. By leveraging the capabilities of machine learning and artificial intelligence, our methodology focuses on addressing crucial battery metrics, including the state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH). Through the ongoing collection and analysis of data obtained from battery systems that are deployed in real-world settings, the framework iteratively improves its predictive models, hence facilitating precise assessment of battery states. Ensuring safety is a crucial element in the management of batteries. The solution we propose utilises anomaly detection algorithms driven by artificial intelligence to detect potential safety issues, facilitating prompt responses and mitigating dangerous circumstances. In order to showcase the efficacy of our methodology, we offer practical implementations in several industries, encompassing the integration of renewable energy, use of electric vehicles, and optimisation of industrial processes. Through the utilisation of cloud-based machine learning techniques, we are able to enhance the efficiency of energy storage and consumption, while simultaneously enhancing the dependability and security of battery systems.

AB  - Recently, the implementation of software/hardware systems based on advanced artificial intelligence techniques for continuous monitoring of the electrical parameters of intelligent networks aimed at managing and controlling energy consumption has been of great interest. The contribution of this paper, starting from a recently studied DC-MG, fits into this context by proposing an intuitionistic fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno approach optimized for the energy management of isolated direct current microgrid systems consisting of a photovoltaic and a wind source. Furthermore, a lead-acid battery guarantees the stability of the DC bus while a hydrogen cell ensures the reliability of the system by avoiding blackout conditions and increasing interaction with the loads. The fuzzy rule bank, initially built using the expert’s knowledge, is optimized with the aforementioned procedure, maximizing external energy and minimizing consumption. The complete scheme, modeled using MatLab/Simulink, highlighted performance comparable to fuzzy Takagi–Sugeno systems optimized using a hybrid approach based on particle swarm optimization (to structure the antecedents of the rules) and minimum batch squares (to optimize the output). © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - A price-based demand response (DR) program is essential for maintaining energy balance in a smart power grid (SPG). Given the uncertainty and stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) and loads, dynamic pricing strategies are required to minimize instant energy shortage risks and ensure energy balancing. This study introduces an optimal adaptive control methodology based on an elastic demand control mechanism using dynamic pricing to address energy balancing in renewable smart microgrids. The proposed optimal adaptive controller, referred to as the ant colony optimization algorithm tuned super-twisting sliding mode controller (ACO-STSMC), effectively handles system nonlinearities and enhances the response of the system to uncertainties and variability of RESs and loads. The ACO-STSMC regulates energy price signals, manages the net load demand, and responds to RESs generation fluctuations, ultimately achieving and maintaining an energy balance in renewable energy smart microgrids. The system exhibits a minimal mismatch between generation and demand, avoids instant demand overshots, and maintains low-energy pricing signal volatility. The findings demonstrate that the developed ACO-STSMC outperforms benchmark controllers such as PSO-PI, PSO-FOPI, PSO-STSMC, ACO-PI, and ACO-FOPI in terms of energy balancing in renewable-energy smart microgrids. The results also confirm that the elastic DR based on dynamic energy pricing with the ACO-STSMC can effectively track the generation of renewable energy smart microgrids. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The climate crisis necessitates a global shift to achieve a secure, sustainable, and affordable energy system toward a green energy transition reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Because of this, renewable energy sources have come to the forefront, and the research interest in microgrids that rely on distributed generation and storage systems has exploded. Furthermore, many new markets for energy trading, ancillary services, and frequency reserve markets have provided attractive investment opportunities in exchange for balancing the supply and demand of electricity. Artificial intelligence can be utilized to locally optimize energy consumption, trade energy with the main grid, and participate in these markets. Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most promising approaches to achieve this goal because it enables an agent to learn optimal behavior in a microgrid by executing specific actions that maximize the long-term reward signal/function. The study focuses on testing two optimization algorithms: logic-based optimization and reinforcement learning. This paper builds on the existing research framework by combining PPO with machine learning-based load forecasting to produce an optimal solution for an industrial microgrid in Norway under different pricing schemes, including day-ahead pricing and peak pricing. It addresses the peak shaving and price arbitrage challenges by taking the historical data into the algorithm and making the decisions according to the energy consumption pattern, battery characteristics, PV production, and energy price. The RL-based approach is implemented in Python based on real data from the site and in combination with MATLAB-Simulink to validate its results. The application of the RL algorithm achieved an average monthly cost saving of 20% compared with logic-based optimization. These findings contribute to digitalization and decarbonization of energy technology, and support the fundamental goals and policies of the European Green Deal. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This paper focuses to identify and validate a more appropriate algorithm to solve the proposed problem. The economic load dispatch (ELD) with the emission parameters becomes more complex and diversified on the involvement of renewable energy sources (RES), and this increases the number of constraints incorporation in the distributed system of classical power system. The integrated economic emission dispatch (IEED) and ELD are a measure of minimizing the fuel cost of generators, minimizing the emitted gaseous pollutants of the conventional generators (CGs) due combustion, and fulfilling the load demand while satisfying the given system constraints. This paper develops and proposes the hybrid moth-flame and mayfly optimization algorithm (MFMFOA), the hybridization of moth-flame optimization (MFO), and mayfly algorithm (MFA) to solve the integrated problem of economic load and emission dispatch, while removing the constraints of the existing optimization algorithms. The overall cost saving of 10.03% and 23.95% was obtained in ELD and IEED, respectively, using MFMFOA. The MFMFOA when correlated with reduced gradient method (RGM), ant colony optimization (ACO), cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), interior search algorithm (ISA), bat algorithm (BA), directional bat algorithm (DBA), and MFO for different cases of ELD and IEED have obtained the comparatively minimum operational cost, a closer global optimum point, and better convergence characteristics. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - This study addresses the durability and performance challenges in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) technology, primarily focusing on optimal humidity management. Acknowledging that, beyond technical aspects, the broader commercialization of PEMFCs is critically influenced by factors such as the cost and availability of hydrogen, this research aims to provide a comprehensive solution to enhance PEMFC applicability. Utilizing Nafion (NR-212), reverse osmosis (RO), and pervaporation (PV) membranes, the study optimizes five key performance metrics: pressure drop (∆P), dew point approach temperature (DPAT), water recovery ratio (WRR), Water Flux (J), and coefficient of performance (COP). These optimizations are conducted considering variables like temperature, humidity, flowrate, and membrane material. A deep neural network (DNN) model, incorporating Bayesian surrogacy with Gaussian process, gradient boost regression trees, and random forest, is developed using experimental data. With a correlation coefficient of 0.986, the model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting performance metrics, subsequently guiding genetic algorithms for effective PEMFC humidity control. The results show significant improvements in all metrics, with optimal values achieved for NR-212, RO, and PV membranes. This study thus presents a novel, practical deep learning approach, considering both technological advancements and external economic factors, for enhancing PEMFC operations. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Over the last three COVID-19 effective years, it was evident that healthcare has been the most sensitive sector to electricity failures. Therefore, if well developed and implemented, a microgrid system with an integrated energy storage system (ESS) installed in hospitals has great potential to provide an uninterrupted and low-energy cost solution. In this article, we target to show the importance of the installed ESS against the problems that will arise from power outages and energy quality problems in hospitals. Besides, it aims to construct an energy management system (EMS) based on the scheduling model to meet the lowest cost of a system containing solar panels, microturbine, gas boiler, and energy storage units that are repurposed lithium-ion batteries from electric vehicles and thermal storage tank. EMS is a mixed-integer linear program to meet the hospital's electricity, heating, and cooling demands with the lowest cost for every hour. The established scheduling model is run for a hospital in Antioch, Türkiye, with 197 beds, 4 operating rooms, 2 resuscitation units, and 9 intensive care units for every hour based on the data in 2019. With the EMS, approximately 25% savings were achieved compared to the previous energy cost. Furthermore, as the result of the net present value calculation, the payback period of the proposed system is estimated to be approximately seven years.  © 1988-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, countries around the world have paid great attention to the development of transportation electrification. As an alternative to achieving carbon neutrality, electric vehicles (EVs) are deemed as the goal of vehicle transformation to achieve zero carbon emissions. However, the challenges of EV energy supplementation have not been adequately investigated, causing concerns about range anxiety, inconvenience of perceived charging service, and so on. By identifying stakeholders and investigating various services under the umbrella of electro-mobility (E-Mobility) services, this article first introduces the concept, population, and challenges of EVs as the key enabler of E-Mobility and then summarizes recent E-Mobility services with holistic insight. Then, overviews of plug-in charging, battery swapping, vehicle-to-vehicle charging, and mobile and wireless charging are introduced, including the objectives, risks, and service optimization categories. Further to the literature review, concern on identifying the gap between academia and industry application is also provided to help coach the technology transformation. From our review, it is observed that flexible and emerging service modes beyond plug-in charging have been receiving great attention from both academia and industry. Therefore, several recent market efforts have been showcased, by following the summarization of mainstream optimization methods applied for E-Mobility services. Finally, this article is concluded with several future direction highlights, including integration of multienergy sources, concern on cybersecurity, application of artificial intelligence (AI), and promotion of global policy to guide wide communities. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Wind energy is an environment friendly, low-carbon, and cost-effective renewable energy source. It is, however, difficult to integrate wind energy into a mixed energy grid due to its high volatility and intermittency. For wind energy conversion systems to be reliable and efficient, accurate wind speed (WS) forecasting is fundamental. This study cascades a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) in order to obtain a model for hourly WS forecasting by utilizing several meteorological variables as model inputs to study their effects on predicted WS. For input selection, the mutation grey wolf optimizer (TMGWO) is used. For efficient optimization of CBiLSTM hyperparameters, a hybrid Bayesian Optimization and HyperBand (BOHB) algorithm is used. The combined usage of TMGWO, BOHB, and CBiLSTM leads to a three-phase hybrid model (i.e., 3P-CBiLSTM). The performance of 3P-CBiLSTM is benchmarked against the standalone and hybrid BiLSTMs, LSTMs, gradient boosting (GBRs), random forest (RFRs), and decision tree regressors (DTRs). The statistical analysis of forecasted WS reveals that the 3P-CBiLSTM is highly effective over the other benchmark forecasting methods. This objective model also registers the highest percentage of forecasted errors (≈ 53.4 – 81.8%) within the smallest error range ≤ |0.25| ms−1 amongst all tested study sites. Despite the remarkable results achieved, the CBiLSTM model cannot be generally understood, so the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) technique was used for explaining local and global model outputs, based on Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Both of the xAI methods determined that the antecedent WS is the most significant predictor of the short-term WS forecasting. Therefore, we aver that the proposed model can be employed to help wind farm operators in making quality decisions in maximizing wind power integration into the grid with reduced intermittency. © 2024 The Author(s)

This helps companies improve resource efficiency and costs while minimizing carbon emissions. The study aims to explore the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the carbon cost reduction of firms. This study investigates how businesses can leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the reduction of carbon costs. Specifically, the research explores the impact of AI-based predictions, decision-making, recommendations, and renewable energy optimization on firms' carbon cost reduction. This research employs a quantitative research design and demonstrates that AI use in decision-making and optimizing renewable energy is highly correlated with carbon cost reduction. The outcomes of the research have significant practical implications for policymakers, and industry professionals in their development of sustainable business practices. Additionally, the research contributes to the literature surrounding AI and sustainability by offering an empirical perspective on how AI can be used to support environmental sustainability efforts, enhance corporate social responsibility, and promote long-term economic gains for firms. The statistical analysis shows that there is a significant impact of AI-based predictions on the reduction of carbon costs in firms. Furthermore, it demonstrates that AI-based decision-making impacts reducing carbon costs for firms. These results highlight the importance of incorporating AI technology into business practices to effectively address sustainability concerns and reduce carbon costs, ultimately promoting long-term economic sustainability and corporate social responsibility. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the present scenario, renewable energy sources are more encouraged to produce power because of their environmental and economic benefits and wide availability. Furthermore, there are further security concerns regarding the feasibility of incorporating bulk wind technology into the existing electrical grid, especially at the transmission level. This article summarizes the modifications made to the current protection system as a result of the integration of large wind farms. Signal distortions are studied in relation to the effects of dynamic fluctuations in the wind parameters, together with the fault and gearbox line parameters. The use of flexible AC gearbox systems (FACTS) and the integration of large amounts of wind energy have made the situation much worse. Different configurations of the potential solutions for such a gearbox system in the presence of both wind and FACT compensating devices are described. In addition to post-fault diagnosis problems brought on by structural changes in the power system, this research also illustrates fault detection of the transmission lines in the presence of bulk wind power. However, the plans put in place after taking the wind system into account need to be secure when the electricity system is running under stress. To demonstrate the impact of power swing and other stressed events, a review of the solutions is given. Useful techniques like signal processing and artificial intelligence are discussed, which are used to obtain enhanced solutions against conventional methods to get better solutions while protecting lines penetrated through wind farms and equipped with FACT devices. A brief discussion is held regarding the advantages that the new solutions have over the conventional ones. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The scientific community widely recognizes that the broad use of renewable energy sources in clean energy systems will become a substantial and common trend in the next decades. The most urgent matter that has to be addressed is how to enhance the amount of renewable energy integration into the system while ensuring system stability in the presence of sudden fluctuations in generation and system faults. This study introduces a methodology that may be applied to any power system to optimize the level of renewable energy sources (RESs) integration. The methodology relies on using a trilayered neural network (TNN), which is a model utilized in the field of artificial intelligence. In order to apply and analyze the outcomes of the proposed optimization technique, the Kundur power system is employed as a case study. The objective of this methodology is to enhance the operation dispatches of a power system to attain a higher level of renewable energy output, specifically photovoltaic (PV) generation, while maintaining the stability of the system. This would enhance the stakeholders’ or utility providers’ capacity to make well-informed judgments on operation dispatch processes. The findings of this study suggest that it is generally recommended to raise the dispatchable power values for the generators in the loading region and lower the dispatchable power values for the generators in the generating area. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Triboelectric nanogenerators offer an environmentally friendly approach to harvesting energy from mechanical excitations. This capability has made them widely sought-after as an efficient, renewable, and sustainable energy source, with the potential to decrease reliance on traditional fossil fuels. However, developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs for real-life applications. Artificial intelligence-enabled inverse design is a powerful tool to realize performance-oriented triboelectric nanogenerators. This is an emerging scientific direction that can address the concerns about the design and optimization of triboelectric nanogenerators leading to a next generation nanogenerator systems. This perspective paper aims at reviewing the principal analysis of triboelectricity, summarizing the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators, and highlighting the physics-informed inverse design strategies to develop triboelectric nanogenerators. Strategic inverse design is particularly discussed in the contexts of expanding the four-mode analytical models by physics-informed artificial intelligence, discovering new conductive and dielectric materials, and optimizing contact interfaces. Various potential development levels of artificial intelligence-enhanced triboelectric nanogenerators are delineated. Finally, the potential of physics-informed artificial intelligence inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators from prototypes to multifunctional intelligent systems for real-life applications is discussed. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - The transition to sustainable electricity generation depends heavily on renewable energy sources, particularly wind power. Making precise forecasts, which calls for clever predictive controllers, is a crucial aspect of maximizing the efficiency of wind turbines. This study presents DeepVELOX, a new methodology. With this method, sophisticated machine learning methods are smoothly incorporated into wind power systems. The Increased Velocity (IN-VELOX) wind turbine framework combines the Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) with the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. Predictive capabilities are entering a new age thanks to this integration. This research presents DeepVELOX, its structure, and results. In particular, this study presents the considerable performance of DeepVELOX. With a MAPE of 0.0002 and an RMSPE of 0.0974, it gets outstanding Key Performance Indicator (KPI) results. The criteria of Accuracy, F1-Score, R2-Score, Precision, and Recall, with a value of 1, further emphasize its performance. The result of this process is an MSE of 0.0352. The significant reduction in forecast disparities is made possible by this system’s remarkable accuracy. Along with improving accuracy, the integration of machine learning algorithms, including GBR, the GWO algorithm, and wind turbine operations, offer a dynamic framework for maximizing power and energy capture. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, the high penetration of renewable energy into the power grid is facing an obvious phenomenon of abandoning wind and light. Microgrid provides a good platform for the full utilization of renewable energy. The coordinated scheduling among multiple microgrids under active distribution network will further improve the utilization rate of renewable energy. Aiming at the problems of reduced distribution reliability, long scheduling time, and poor load balance in the current multi-microgrid access distribution network scheduling methods, an active distribution network hierarchical scheduling algorithm based on multi-microgrid system is designed. Construct a multi-microgrid active distribution network two-level planning model, optimize the energy storage configuration of the microgrid system, and control the battery capacity, charge and discharge performance and the equivalent voltage state of the grid at the same time, to provide support for the distribution network load balancing dispatch. Cross-source scheduling method combined with big data technology is used to preprocess active distribution network load. The improved ant colony optimization algorithm is used to construct the analytical model of the corresponding user type of the hierarchical dispatching terminal of the active distribution network to complete the dispatching optimization. According to the expected adjusted hierarchical load proportion distribution, combined with the ant colony optimization results, the hierarchical scheduling of active distribution network is realized. The IEEE 14-bus distribution network system is taken as an example to verify the algorithm. The experimental results show that under the proposed algorithm, the daily average deviation between the pre-measurement and the actual quantity of distribution power transmission in multi-microgrid is less than 2%, the maximum load balancing degree after scheduling is 99.8%, and the scheduling overhead is less than 0.95 s. It can realize the accurate prediction of electric energy transmission in active distribution network, the effect of load hierarchical scheduling is good, the load balance is ideal, and the scheduling time overhead is small. © 2022, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

AB  - Concerning the advantages of smart microgrids and the importance of selecting and using technologies accustomed to optimized planning and design of typology and capacity of supplies, demand response programs, and energy-storage charges, existing research has focused on the optimized design of microgrids using ant colony optimization algorithm. Conditions of the optimization problem are enacted on the objective function based on the technical and operational limitations of supplies and microgrids, which may lead to the limitation of response space of the problem. Additionally, a methodology is proposed for modeling and analyzing a novel design to consider the uncertainty of production and demand with reverse risk in the design of residential microgrids. The proposed methodology focuses on the uncertainty of photovoltaic production and load demand by solving two-dimensional multipurpose optimization problem based on information gap decision theory (IGDT). In the mentioned approach, the photovoltaic generation's uncertainty and charge of photovoltaic generation are integrated into an equation to be solved as a problem. Regardless of the likelihood density function of uncertainty parameters and without preparing a firm framework, the current method integrates wind and photovoltaic production into the microgrids. The results of the mentioned method are conclusive, which make the problems solvable.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Energy storage systems are expected to play a fundamental part in the integration of increasing renewable energy sources into the electric system. They are already used in power plants for different purposes, such as absorbing the effect of intermittent energy sources or providing ancillary services. For this reason, it is imperative to research managing and sizing methods that make power plants with storage viable and profitable projects. In this paper, a managing method is presented, where particle swarm optimisation is used to reach maximum profits. This method is compared to expert systems, proving that the former achieves better results, while respecting similar rules. The paper further presents a sizing method which uses the previous one to make the power plant as profitable as possible. Finally, both methods are tested through simulations to show their potential. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Generator-absorber heat exchange (GAX) systems represent a promising alternative to substitute environmentally harmful refrigeration devices based on conventional vapor compression, as long as a proper analysis of thermal performance and the complex interactions of heat transfer that occur into GAX cycle is taken in consideration. In this research, a cooling process based on a GAX system that uses ammonia-water working fluid and a hybrid source (natural gas-solar) is studied to analyze the variables that affect the system's thermal performance. The work's novelty is the hybridization between artificial intelligence (AI) modeling and the global sensitivity analysis (GSA) developed with the PAWN method. Experimental data was obtained from a system with a cooling capacity of 10.5 kW (3 Ton), designed to work at heat source temperatures of 200 °C. The measured variables were the temperatures at generator, heat at evaporator, and working fluid volumetric flow. Three AI techniques (artificial neural networks, genetic programming, and support vector machines) were evaluated for modeling the thermodynamic cycle. Results obtained from the PAWN method applied to the artificial neural network, since it was the best AI model, indicates that the operational parameters with a greater impact in the system's performance are the inlet temperature at the generator (30.7 %) and the heat measured at the evaporator for NH3 (27.4 %), for the first output COPNH3. For the second output COPH2O, the inlet temperature at the generator (32.5 %) and the and heat measured at the evaporator for H2O (26.7 %), have a greater impact for such output. The proposed IA-GSA methodology contributes to the development of operational decision-making related to instrumentation, operation performance, and corrective and/or preventive maintenance actions of GAX systems. The developed thermal performance model has potential for implementation in embedded systems (smart sensors) as a critical element in control and optimization strategies to improve the performance of these cycles. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The key variables in the development and operation of wind and solar power systems are wind speed and solar radiation. The prediction of solar and wind energy parameters is important to alleviate the effects of power generation fluctuations. Consequently, it is essential to predict renewable energy sources like solar radiation and wind speed precisely. An artificial intelligence-based random forest method is recommended in this paper to estimate wind speed and solar radiation. The number of decision trees in the random forest model is suggested to be optimised using a novel coot algorithm (CA), and the effectiveness of the CA is evaluated to that of the currently used particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method. The best forecasting data are used in this work to develop a dynamic Microgrid (MG) in MATLAB/SIMULINK. A novel binary CA is proposed to control the MG to minimize the cost. The effect of the energy storage system is also investigated during the simulation of the MG. © 2023 Wydawnictwo SIGMA-NOT. All rights reserved.

AB  - Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro are becoming increasingly popular due to the fewer negative impacts they have on the environment. Because, Since the production of renewable energy sources is still in the process of being created, photovoltaic (PV) systems are commonly utilized for installation situations that are acceptable, clean, and simple. This study presents an adaptive artificial intelligence approach that can be used for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in solar systems with the help of an embedded controller. The adaptive method incorporates both the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The WOA was implemented to enhance the process of the ANN model's training, and the ANN model was developed using the WOA. In addition to this, the inverter circuit is connected to the smart grid system, and the strengthening of the smart grid is achieved through the implementation of the CMCMAC protocol. This protocol prevents interference between customers and the organizations that provide their utilities. Using a protocol known as Cross-Layer Multi-Channel MAC (CMCMAC), the effect of interference is removed using the way that was suggested. Also, with the utilization of the ZIGBEE communication technology, bidirectional communication is made possible. The strategy that was suggested has been put into practice, and the results have shown that the PV system produces an output power of 73.32KWand an efficiency of 98.72%. In addition to this, a built-in regulator is utilized to validate the proposed model. In this paper, the results of various experiments are analyzed, and a comparison is made between the suggested WOA with the ANN controller approach and others, such as the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based MPPT and the Cuckoo Search (CS) based MPPT. By examining the comparison findings, it was determined that the adaptive AI-based embedded controller was superior to the other alternatives. © 2023 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electricity market decarbonization using renewable energies is essential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the identification of the optimum electrical mix for each country is a challenging and complex task because of the many boundary conditions that must be taken into account, thus demanding the use of advanced analysis and computing tools. This paper presents a methodology based on artificial intelligence developed for this purpose and the results obtained when applied to the specific case of the Spanish electricity market long-term decarbonization. It also shows how effective this methodology is to find the optimum electrical mix fulfilling previously defined objectives: 100% coverage of the demand while simultaneously minimizing the electricity cost and curtailments. Results show the significant barriers to achieve a 100% renewable electrical mix without excessive curtailments or installed power. The methodology described here is suitable for any other country and target objectives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Microbial electrolysis cell-assisted anaerobic digestion (MEC-AD) is a promising emerging strategy to enhance simultaneously waste treatment and biomethane recovery from various biowastes, particularly waste-activated sludge (WAS). However, MEC-AD is still in the early stages of development, with numerous experimental studies but no modeling or optimization. Thus, to provide an effective modeling and optimization tool for this process, this study proposed applying artificial intelligence for the first time. The literature-based experimental data of MEC-AD fed with alkaline-pretreated waste-activated sludge (al-WAS) were used for this purpose. Accordingly, a two-hidden-layer artificial neural network (ANN) with topology 2–25–34–6, obtained from the response surface methodology, showed the best agreement between actual and predicted data with a low mean squared error of 0.0579 and a high R-value of 0.9870. This best ANN model was then optimized by particle swarm optimization. As a result, an Eapp of 0.63 V was found to be optimal for al-WAS-fed MEC-AD with a highest net energy output of 41.3 KJ/L-reactor (∼2.6 MJ/kg-WAS) and highest net monetary value of 0.72 $/L-reactor (∼45 $/kg-WAS), which enhanced around 160 % and 300 % compared to AD alone. These findings can support decision-making for managers and operators in wastewater treatment, biomass waste management, and renewable energy sectors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The variability of renewable energies and their integration into the grid via power electronics demands the design of robust control algorithms. This work incorporates two techniques to ensure the stability of a boost converter through its state equations, implementing the inverse optimal control and the gain-scheduling technique for robust control settings. In such a way that, under a single adjustment, it is capable of damping different changes such as changes in the parameters, changes in the load, the input voltage, and the reference voltage. On the other hand, inverse optimal control is based on a discrete-time control Lyapunov function (CLF), and CLF candidate depends on fixed parameters that are selected to obtain the solution for inverse optimal control. Once these parameters have been found through heuristic or artificial intelligence methods, the new proposed methodology is capable of obtaining a robust optimal control scheme, without having to search for new parameters through other methods, since these are sometimes sensitive changes and many times the process of a new search is delayed. The results of the approach are simulated using Matlab, obtaining good performance of the proposed control under different operation conditions. Such simulations yielded errors of less than 1% based on the voltage reference, given the disturbances caused by changes in the input variables, system parameters, and changes in the reference. Thus, applying the new methodology, the stability of our system was preserved in all cases. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Load anomalies in power distribution systems are relatively rare, yielding imbalanced classification datasets. Consequently, traditional artificial intelligence approaches for detecting load anomalies tend to be relatively inaccurate or rely heavily on pre-processing optimization. Reasoning that hyperdimensional computing (HDC) lends itself naturally to classification with imbalanced datasets, we present an HDC-based method for detecting anomalies accurately and in real time using raw meter data without prior optimization. An associative memory is used to classify the hypervectors, providing resilience against data imbalance. Moreover, a novel retraining function is designed to further improve classification accuracy. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world datasets from two sources with significantly different characteristics—a US university campus that relies on state-of-the-art power monitoring and uses mostly non-renewable energy sources, and a rural village in Tanzania that relies on wireless monitoring and uses 100% solar energy. In comparison with traditional AI approaches, it achieves consistently higher accuracy and runtime efficiency on both datasets and under a wide variety of evaluation metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first investigation of HDC for anomaly detection in smart grids. Our results show that HDC-based methods have considerable potential for accurate real-time detection of load anomalies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Emergency load shedding is an effective and frequently used emergency control action for power system transient stability. Solving the full optimization models for load shedding is computational burdensome and thus slow react to the intense system variations from the increasing renewable energy sources and the more active demand-side behavior. Other sensitivity-based methods impair the control accuracy and may not guarantee global optimality. Artificial intelligence methods, as the data-driven approaches, have recently been well-recognized for its real-time decision-making capability to tackle the system variations. The existing artificial intelligence methods for emergency load shedding are based on shallow learning algorithms and can lead to both load under-cutting and over-cutting events. However, when the loads are under-cut, the power system will be exposed to a high risk of post-control instability that can propagate into cascading events, which incurs significantly higher cost than an over-cutting event. Being aware of such unbalanced control costs, this paper proposes a risk-averse deep learning method for real-time emergency load shedding, which trains deep neural network towards the reluctance to load under-cutting events, so as to avoid the huge control cost incurred by control failure. The case studies on two renewable power systems demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed risk-averse method can significantly improve the control success rate with negligible increase in prediction error, ending up with lower overall control cost. The results verify the enhanced control performance and the practical values of the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Optimization of the sizing and operation strategy of a complex energy system requires a large computational burden because of the non-linear nature of the mathematical problem. Accordingly, using a conventional numerical method with only a physics-based model for complete optimization is impractical. To resolve this problem, this paper adopted an optimization method of using an artificial intelligence scheme that combines an artificial neural network (ANN) and a genetic algorithm (GA). Especially, the ANN was constructed based on results from a physics-based model to obtain a large amount of accurate simulation data in a short time frame. A distributed generation (DG) system based on a gas turbine (GT) and renewable energy (RE) was simulated to demonstrate the usefulness of the optimization method. In consideration of the capacity and partial load performance of the GT, the optimization of the sizing and operation strategy of the DG system was performed for three system design scenarios. The optimization criteria were cost-effectiveness and eco-friendliness. The method reduced the calculation time by more than three orders of magnitude while maintaining the same accuracy as the physics-based model. The approach and methodology are expected to be applicable to accurate and fast optimization of various sophisticated energy systems. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources has become neces-sary, especially in isolated microgrids. This increase leads to a decrease in the total inertia of the microgrids, which affects microgrid stability. Moreover, voltage and frequency control in low-inertia microgrids is more difficult and sensitive. Objective: Improve low inertia isolated microgrids' dynamic response and save the microgrid stability at different contingency and uncertainty conditions. Moreover, it allows for more penetration of renewable energy sources. Methods: Proposing different control strategies based on virtual inertia control. The first is a propor-tional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and then, to allow for more tuning flexibility, a fraction-al-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller is used. MATLAB™/Simulink is used to compare the response of the isolated microgrid without virtual inertia control, with conventional virtual inertia control, PID-based virtual inertia control, and FOPID-based virtual inertia control. The PID and FOPID controllers’ parameters are tuned using the ant colony optimization (ACO) technique. Results: The proposed control techniques save the isolated microgrids' stability at different penetration levels of renewable energy sources and operating conditions. At the same time, the isolated mi-crogrid without virtual inertia control or conventional virtual inertia control can not save its stability in many operating conditions. Conclusion: The proposed fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID)-based virtual inertia control has proven its effectiveness in saving the isolated microgrid stability and gives the best controller response. FOPID-based virtual inertia control minimizes the frequency deviation with different disturbances and operating conditions. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Variable Renewable Energy(VRE) is impossible to maintain stable output due to uncertainty and intermittency. In this paper, Photovoltaic(PV) output is predicted through deep learning prediction technology and compared with the actual PV output. The data used as the input of the deep learning prediction model was partially selected through correlation analysis to reduce overfitting and to have high prediction performance. A Hyperparameter optimization model was used in several deep learning prediction models and the Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) prediction model was selected after comparing the performances. The difference between Predicted PV output and actual PV is compensated using Battery Energy Storage System(BESS). Moreover, the BESS capacity is calculated and the BESS State of Charge (SoC) range profile is observed.

AB  - The use of renewable energy resources in the production of electrical energy is becoming prevalent due to the decreasing installation costs of these resources and increasing environmental concerns. A Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) is beneficial for meeting load demands, but optimal sizing is the main problem in the process of obtaining a cost-efficient system based on certain load demands and techno-economic parameters. In this article, the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm was used for the optimal sizing of components and compared to other methods. The HRESs consisted of photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine, battery, diesel generator and inverter components. A powerful rule-based energy management scheme was introduced to manage the power flow between system parts which constitute the microgrid that will minimize the annual system cost and reliably meet the energy demand. The decision variables for this optimization were the PV panel power, wind power, and the number of batteries. Simulation results revealed that HS provided the optimum sizing among the other methods including HOMER, Ant Colony Optimizer and Jaya. The time performances of the algorithms were also examined, and the HS algorithm had better performance and convergence properties. The optimization process was programmed using the MATLAB simulation package. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Because of the fast expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) in Saudi Arabia, a massive amount of energy will be needed to serve these vehicles. In addition, the transportation sector radiates a considerable amount of toxic gases in the form of SO2 and CO2. The national grid must supply a huge amount of electricity on a regular basis to meet the increasing power demands of EVs. This study thoroughly investigates the technical and economic benefits of an off-grid and grid-connected hybrid energy system with various configurations of a solar, wind turbine and battery energy storage system for the electric vehicle charging load in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. The goal is to decrease the cost of energy while reducing the chance of power outages in the system. This is achieved by using a new optimization algorithm called the modified salp swarm optimization algorithm (MSSOA), which is based on an evolutionary algorithm approach. MSSOA is an improved version of SSOA, which addresses its shortcomings. It has two search strategies to enhance its efficiency: first, it uses Levy flight distribution (LFD) to help individuals reach new positions faster, and second, it instructs individuals to spiral around the optimal solution, improving the exploitation phase. The MSSOA’s effectiveness is confirmed by comparing its results with those of the conventional salp swarm optimization algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO). According to simulation findings, MSSOA has excellent accuracy and robustness. In this region, the SPV/WT/BESS-based EV charging station is the optimal option for EV charging stations. The SPV/WT/BESS design has the lowest LCOE of all feasible configurations in the region under study. The optimum values for the LCOE and TNPC using MSSOA are USD 0.3697/kWh and USD 99,928.34, which are much lower than the optimized values for the LCOE (USD 0.4156) and TNPC (USD 1,12,671.75) using SSOA. Furthermore, a comprehensive techno–economic analysis of optimized hybrid systems is assessed by incorporating the grid-connected option. The grid connected system results in optimized values of the LCOE (USD 0.0732/kWh) and TNPC (USD 1,541,076). The impact of different grid purchase prices on the levelized cost of energy is also studied. Our results will assist the researchers to determine the best technique for the optimization of an optimal energy system. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Because solar energy is among the renewable energies, it has traditionally been used to provide lighting in buildings. When solar energy is effectively utilized during the day, the environment is not only more comfortable for users, but it also utilizes energy more efficiently for both heating and cooling purposes. Because of this, increasing the building’s energy efficiency requires first controlling the amount of light that enters the space. Considering that the only parts of the building that come into direct contact with the sun are the windows, it is essential to make use of louvers in order to regulate the amount of sunlight that enters the building. Through the use of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), the purpose of this study is to estimate the proportions and technical specifications of external louvers, as well as to propose a model for designing the southern openings of educational space in order to maximize energy efficiency and intelligent consumption, as well as to ensure that the appropriate amount of light is provided. According to the findings of this research, the design of external louvers is heavily influenced by a total of five distinct aspects: the number of louvers, the depth of the louvers, the angle of rotation of the louvers, the distance between the louvers and the window, and the reflection coefficient of the louvers. The results of the 2067 simulated case study show that the best reflection rates of the louvers are between 0 and 15 percent, and the most optimal distance between the louvers and the window is in the range of 0 to 18 centimeters. Additionally, the results show that the best distance between the louvers and the window is in the range of 0 to 18 centimeters. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interest in renewable energy is growing in every corner of the world. Most renewable power, by definition, produces energy on a temporary basis; the integrations of renewable energies into electric grids are the challenging task, as renewable power is often intermittent. Transceivers play an important role in measuring, operations, and security of renewables producers and power grids, making them a vital piece of technology in this link to the grid. In order to get the most out of energy converters installed in three-phase, four-wire distributors, and this article proposes a novel control method for energy converters using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are the types of artificial intelligence that can be used to learn complex relationships between input and output data. In this case, the input data is the state of the inverter and the output data is the control signals. It used to be governing inverters so that they can perform the duties of a multifunctional device Simulation studies in Simulink and MATLAB are used to demonstrate this novel control paradigm, and the experimental data from lab work with DSPs provides further confirmation. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The reduction of adverse environmental effects and the socioeconomic advantages of renewable energy systems promote greater integration of distributed energy systems into the traditional electrical networks. A new type of sharing economy is emerging with the sharing of energy resources to reduce transaction costs by using platform services in the cloud. Given the obstacles posed by the legacy system and various forms of renewable energy integration, Distributed Energy and Micro Grids (DE-MG) are an efficient means of raising the quality of energy services. Rules for microgrid scalability, maintaining a budget, and security can make this difficult. Consumers are better at receiving the best renewable energy allotment price using a cloud-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. The main objective is to lower the daily energy cost of microgrid power in commercial buildings. In the proposed work, cloud-based P2P for peer-Multi Agent System (p-MAS) optimization techniques are used to reduce system peak and integrated Demand Response (DR) with Energy Management System (EMS) in a commercial MG. To fill knowledge gaps about how various power market architectures and individual decision-making processes impact local interactions and market outcomes, cloud-based P2P for Modelling Leveraging Agents (MLA) is used for bill calculation. A performance measure is finally created for cost evaluation and reliability to measure the social benefits of cloud-based P2P models for exchanging energy. For various price environments and resource types, a comparison between the proposed cloud-based P2P model with an existing P2P model for exchanging energy is provided. The primary use of a distributed P2P model for exchanging power in a microgrid is to reduce electricity costs and increase grid environment reliability. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - A proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based back-to-back VSC-HVDC emergency control strategy based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed for use in an energy management system (EMS). In this scheme, an advanced DRL algorithm is proposed by implementing both PPO and a communication neural network for large power systems. The PPO modeled as intelligent agents with objective functions have shown a higher convergence performance than have existing DRL algorithms. Further, the model was demonstrated to effectively address voltage variances caused by the high penetration of renewable energy sources. By implementing PPO, the learning procedure is stabilized and made robust to continuous changes in network topology. To escalate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a comprehensive case studies were conducted on an standard test systems and Korean power system considering variations in load and PV generation and a weak centralized communication environment. The results indicate that outstanding control performance and autonomously regulated bus voltage and line flows, thereby validating the effectiveness of the method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy forecasting plays an important role in effective power grid management. The widespread adoption of emerging technologies and the increased reliance on renewable sources of energy have created a need for a robust and accurate system for energy forecasting. This demand is becoming increasingly relevant due to the ongoing 2022 energy crisis. Modern power systems are very complex with many complicated correlations between various forecasting factors and parameters. Furthermore, renewable energy is often dependent on weather conditions, which complicates the process of forecasting. This work presents a novel artificial intelligence (AI) driven energy forecasting tuned deep learning framework. By formatting predictors as a time series, two variations of recurrent neural networks (RNN)s have been implemented: long-short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks. However, both approaches present several hyperparameters that require adequate tuning to attain desirable performance. Therefore, this work also proposes an improved version of a well know swarm intelligence algorithm, the sine cosine algorithm (SCA), tasked with tackling hyperparameter tuning for both approaches. To demonstrate the improvements made, three datasets have been constructed for evaluation from publicly available real-world data that contain relevant solar, wind, and power-grid load parameters alongside weather data. The proposed metaheuristic algorithm has been subjected to a comparative analysis with several contemporary metaheuristic algorithms to showcase the improvements made. The introduced metaheuristic demonstrated the best performance with a mean square error (MSE) rate for solar generation of only 0.0132 with LSTM methods and 0.0134 with GRU. Similar performance was observed for wind power generation forecasting with a MSE of 0.00292 with LSTM and 0.00287. When tackling power grid load forecasting a median MSE of 0.0162 was attained with LSTM and 0.01504 with GRU. Therefore there is great potential for tackling these tasks using the proposed approach. The best-performing models have been analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to determine the factors that have the highest influence on energy generation and demand. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Globally, research on battery technology to be utilized in electric vehicle applications is rapidly expanding to solve the problems of greenhouse emissions and global warming. The efficiency of Electric Vehicles (EVs) are highly depends on the precise measurement of significant factors, as well as on the appropriate operation and analysis of the battery storage system. Unfortunately, inadequate battery storage system monitoring and safety measures can result in serious problems such battery over-charging, over-discharging, overloading, imbalanced cells, heat explosion, and combustion hazards. The quantity of a battery’s energy in respect to its capability is described to as the state of charge (SOC). SOC is measured in percentage points and is estimated as the distance between the battery’s maximum possible output and its average energy at a specific time under the same issues. State of health (SOH) is the evaluation of a battery’s maximum charge amount compared to its starting value when it is first discharged. SOH is calculated using percentage points as its variables. An efficient battery management system, which includes tailored to the content, charging-discharging control, thermal regulation, battery protection and security, is essential for addressing these issues. This paper’s objective is to provide a thorough analysis of various intelligent control strategies and battery management system methodologies used in the EV applications. Also, the review assesses the smart algorithms for estimating battery state in terms of their attributes, customization, arrangement, accuracy, benefits, and drawbacks. Finally, prospects and directions for developing a successful sophisticated algorithm and controller are presented in order to create an enhanced battery management system for applications in future, eco-friendly EV technology. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Ocean-going ships are one of the primary sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Several actions are being taken to reduce the GHG emissions from maritime vessels, and integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is one of them. Ocean-going marine ships need a large amount of reliable energy to support the propulsive load. Intermittency is one of the drawbacks of RESs, and penetration of RESs in maritime vessels is limited by the cargo carrying capacity and usable area of that ship. Other types of reliable energy sources need to be incorporated in ships to overcome these shortcomings of RESs. Some researchers proposed to integrate fossil fuel-based generators like diesel generators and renewable energy in marine vessels to reduce GHG emissions. As the penetration of RESs in marine ships is limited, fossil fuel-based generators provide most of the en-ergy. Therefore, renewable and fossil fuel-based hybrid energy systems in maritime vessels can not reduce GHG emissions to the desired level. Fossil fuel-based generators need to be replaced by emissions-free energy sources to make marine ships free from emissions. Nuclear energy is emis-sions-free energy, and small-scale nuclear reactors like Microreactors (MRs) are competent to re-place fossil fuel-based generators. In this paper, the technical, environmental, and economic competitiveness of Nuclear-Renewable Hybrid Energy Systems (N-R HES) in marine ships are assessed. The lifecycle cost of MR, reliability of the proposed system, and limitations of integrating renewable energy in maritime vessels are considered in this study. The proposed N-R HES is compared with three different energy systems, namely ‘Standalone Fossil Fuel-based Energy Systems’, ‘Renewable and Fossil Fuel-based Hybrid Energy Systems’, and ‘Standalone Nuclear Energy System’. The cost modeling of each energy system is carried out in MATLAB simulator. Each energy system is optimized by using the Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA), an artificial intelligence algorithm, to find out the optimal configuration of the system components in terms of Net Present Cost (NPC). The results determine that N-R HES has the lowest NPC compared to the other three energy sys-tems. The performance of the DE algorithm is compared with another widely accepted artificial intelligence optimization technique called ‘Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)’ to validate the findings of the DE algorithm. The impact of control parameters in the DE algorithm is assessed by em-ploying the Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE) algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the impact of different system parameters on this study’s findings. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The energy storage system (ESS) is developing into a very important element for the stable operation of power systems. An ESS is characterized by rapid control, free charging, and discharg-ing. Because of these characteristics, it can efficiently respond to sudden events that affect the power system and can help to resolve congested lines caused by the excessive output of distributed generators (DGs) using renewable energy sources (RESs). In order to efficiently and economically install new ESSs in the power system, the following two factors must be considered: the optimal installation placements and the optimal sizes of ESSs. Many studies have explored the optimal installation placement and the sizing of ESSs by using analytical approaches, mathematical optimization tech-niques, and artificial intelligence. This paper presents an algorithm to determine the optimal installation placement and sizing of ESSs for a virtual multi‐slack (VMS) operation based on a power sensitivity analysis in a stand‐alone microgrid. Through the proposed algorithm, the optimal installation placement can be determined by a simple calculation based on a power sensitivity matrix, and the optimal sizing of the ESS for the determined placement can be obtained at the same time. The algorithm is verified through several case studies in a stand‐alone microgrid based on practical power system data. The results of the proposed algorithm show that installing ESSs in the optimal placement could improve the voltage stability of the microgrid. The sizing of the newly installed ESS was also properly determined. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) are promising solutions for offshore renewable energy harvesting, with the successful installation and operation of the world's first commercial floating wind farm, Hywind Scotland, in 2017. However, both academia and industry are still constantly facing challenges in the aspects of cost reduction, monitoring, safety and sustainability improvement for the design and maintenance of FOWTs. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate an engineering application of a novel Artificial Intelligence knowledge-based method, named SADA, on the full-scale measurement data of an Hywind FOWT. The SADA method was applied to perform numerical optimization and dynamic responses prediction of the FOWTs, based on the full-scale data from one Hywind FOWT in Scotland. The methodology of SADA and the key technology of the application are introduced firstly. Then, the selection of Key Discipline Parameters (KDPs) is introduced, followed with the training of AI-based numerical models with full-scale measurement data, including Floater motions, wind, wave and current data. After that, the numerical model imbedded in SADA is trained to be intelligent for the objective Hywind FOWT under different sea states. The intelligent SADA model is used to do comparisons and predictions. The comparison results show that using SADA method, the AI-trained numerical model can predict the motions of Hywind supporting Floater in higher accuracy. In addition, other physical quantities that cannot be obtained directly in full-scale measurement easily but are of great concern by industry, can also be obtained from a more believable perspective. This AI-based SADA method brings an innovative vision for FOWTs' full-scale measurement technology in the future. © 2021

AB  - The rapid growth of electric vehicles in India necessitates more power to energize such vehicles. Furthermore, the transport industry emits greenhouse gases, particularly SO2, CO2. The national grid has to supply an enormous amount of power on a daily basis due to the surplus power required to charge these electric vehicles. This paper presents the various hybrid energy system configurations to meet the power requirements of the electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) situated in the northwest region of Delhi, India. The three configurations are: (a) solar photovoltaic/diesel generator/battery-based EVCS, (b) solar photovoltaic/battery-based EVCS, and (c) grid-and-solar photovoltaic-based EVCS. The meta-heuristic techniques are implemented to analyze the technological, financial, and environmental feasibility of the three possible configurations. The optimization algorithm intends to reduce the total net present cost and levelized cost of energy while keeping the value of lack of power supply probability within limits. To confirm the solution quality obtained using modified salp swarm algorithm (MSSA), the popularly used HOMER software, salp swarm algorithm (SSA), and the gray wolf optimization are applied to the same problem, and their outcomes are equated to those attained by the MSSA. MSSA exhibits superior accuracy and robustness based on simulation outcomes. The MSSA performs much better in terms of computation time followed by the SSA and gray wolf optimization. MSSA results in reduced levelized cost of energy values in all three configurations, i.e., USD 0.482/kWh, USD 0.684/kWh, and USD 0.119/kWh in configurations 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Our findings will be useful for researchers in determining the best method for the sizing of energy system components. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents an economical approach to control frequency of an isolated three area hybrid micro grid system (3A-HµGS) with the coordinated participation of plug in electric vehicles (PEVs). In addition to diesel generators, an integration of EV fleets to the micro grid as a dynamic device makes the system more reliable and highly controllable. PEVs are connected to the hybrid system as a source and a load under the scenario of deficit and surplus power respectively. It is thus here used as an economical load frequency controller. The performance of the proposed system with PEVs has been analyzed under the degree of penetration of different renewable energy sources like wind energy, parabolic trough, photovoltaic arrays, and biogas power system in all three different areas respectively. Moreover, artificial intelligence like genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and mine blast algorithm based proportional-integral-derivative controllers are also implemented to contain the system frequency under different circumstances such as load variation, unpredictable change in wind velocity and uncontrolled solar irradiance. Comparative analysis of the dynamic responses and the numerical results of the system with different algorithms ascertain that the coordinated participation of PEVs diminishes the power and frequency deviation of the proposed hybrid micro grid system. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.

AB  - The use of formal methods and artificial intelligence has made it possible to automatically design outdoor lighting. Quick design for large cities, in a matter of hours instead of weeks, and analysis of various optimization criteria enables to save energy and tune profit stream from lighting retrofit. Since outdoor lighting is of a large scale, having luminaires on every street in urban areas, and since it needs to be retrofitted every 10 to 15 years, choosing proper parameters and light sources leads to significant energy savings. This paper presents the concept and calculations of Levelized Cost of Electricity for outdoor lighting retrofit. It is understood as cost of energy savings, it is in the range from 23.06 to 54.64 EUR/MWh, based on real-world cases. This makes street and road lighting modernization process the best green “energy source” if compared with the 2018 Fraunhofer Institute cost of electricity renewable energy technologies ranking. This indicates that investment in lighting retrofit is more economically and ecologically viable than investment in new renewable energy sources. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Solar and wind based renewable energy sources are highly variable according to unstable energy sources due to variable meteorological conditions. Providing a stable DC bus voltage to the inverter’s input by eliminating voltage fluctuations in the generated electrical energy is the main concern of researchers and is highly sensitive in the integration of distributed energy sources. In this study, in order to provide stable and sustainable output voltage at the output of a DC/DC converter, parametric simulation studies are carried out according to different input voltage, duty ratio, and switching frequency values of a DC/DC power converter circuit in a system fed with a solar energy source. Using this dataset obtained from a solar energy source, a parameter estimation in the smart grid structure is studied using artificial hybrid prediction intelligence techniques. Grey wolf and marine predators optimization algorithms are integrated to the multilayer perceptron in the stage of developing the hybrid prediction models. Then, the accuracy of the prediction processes is tested and verified with the power electronics circuit software. Thus, a data analysis approach based on parametric simulation studies in smart grid structures is reported in order to give clear ideas to researchers before designing a prototype. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The increasing integration of wind energy into power systems has underscored the urgent need for accurate energy production forecasting. This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in predicting wind energy production. Capitalizing on the flexibility and learning capabilities of AI, this study explores the potential to enhance the prediction accuracy of wind energy output and, in turn, contribute to the more efficient integration of wind power into the power grid. Our hypothetical data, derived from representative wind farms, allows for an extensive analysis of various AI techniques. The data set includes key influencing parameters like wind speed, direction, temperature, air pressure, and turbine specifications. Through iterative learning and pattern recognition, these AI models are trained to predict energy production based on the given parameters. The study aims to establish an empirical comparison between these AI techniques, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses in the context of wind energy forecasting. Additionally, it seeks to identify the most effective AI models for different wind farm conditions, thereby providing a robust tool for energy production prediction. The ultimate objective of this study is to improve wind energy management and grid reliability. Accurate forecasting can lead to optimal turbine operation, improved maintenance schedules, and efficient power grid integration, facilitating a smoother transition to renewable energy sources. This comprehensive analysis represents a significant stride towards realizing the full potential of AI in renewable energy, laying a strong foundation for future research in this domain. By continually refining and expanding upon these AI techniques, we can aspire to make renewable energy a more predictable, reliable, and integral part of our power systems. © 2023, International Organization on 'Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering'.

AB  - The variability and uncertainty caused by the increased penetrations of renewable energy sources must be properly considered in day-ahead unit commitment, optimal power flow, and even real-time economic dispatch problems. Besides achieving minimum cost, modern generation schedules must satisfy a larger set of different complex constraints. These account for the generation constraints in the presence of renewable generation, network constraints affected by the distributed energy resources, bilateral contracts enclosing independent capacity provision, ancillary power auctions, net-metering and feed-in-tariff prosumers, and corrective security actions in sudden load variations or outage circumstances. In this work, a new method is presented to appropriately enhance the integration of distributed energy resources in low-inertia power grids. Based on optimal unit commitment schedules derived from priority-based dynamic programming, the potential of increasing the renewable capacity was examined, performing simulations for different scenarios. To ameliorate the expensive requirement of computational complexity, this approach aimed at eliminating the increased exploration-exploitation efforts. On the contrary, its promising solution relies on the evolutionary commitment of the next optimum configuration based on priority-list schemes to accommodate the intermittent generation progressively. This is achieved via the collection of mappings that transform many-valued clausal forms into satisfiability equivalent Boolean expressions. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This article approaches the optimal solution of energy sustainability based on the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The application of renewable energy sources (RES) and unit commitment (UC) is the basic idea of this concept. Therefore, a new approach to solving the UC problem is introduced. The proposed method has a simple procedure to obtain the popular solutions in an acceptable time interval, by creating a basic model of the schedule of the state of energy units RES. It is obvious that individual consumer units, of an operational nature, take hourly performance values by performing economic evaluations on them in the sense of cost optimization. This is conducted through an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm by optimizing the dedicated cost function, simulated by annealing. Despite the acceptable solution obtained from these two steps, another shift is proposed, called the TDD process in a given consumer area. This process in the application of AI in the system of selection of universal load TDD from hundreds of possible ones is based on the use of artificial neural networks and cluster analysis, which is represented by the application of the Kohonen map. This logical process to achieve a modified solution is a self-organizing map (SOM). It is a software tool for visualizing high-dimensional data. Converts complex, nonlinear statistical relationships (functions) between high-dimensional data to simple geometric relationships, low-dimensional representation. The output of SOM is an optimized load TDD on the basis of which the process of automatic control of UC in the local urban area is built. The results of the AI application in the case of sustainable energy solutions confirm that this UC method provides a robust solution to an almost optimal solution. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - The volatility of renewable energy leads to numerous voltage changes in a short period, thus affecting the quality of the power supply. A real-time smart voltage control framework of cyber-physical social power systems is proposed to replace the traditional multi-timescale “reactive power optimization and voltage regulation” framework. This work combines artificial emotion, deep learning, and Q learning as an artificial emotional deep Q-learning algorithm. The proposed framework and algorithm are simulated in the developed parallel smart voltage control platform. The proposed algorithm has a strong-robust capability of real-time online updating, learning, and decision-making. Furthermore, four virtual systems simulating the actual smart voltage control systems are built. Compared to the conventional proportional-integral-derivative, the voltage deviation of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 68.95%. Among six uniform time-scale algorithms, the proposed algorithm has the highest control performance and the lowest control error. Besides, the parameters of the proposed algorithm are continuously optimized to enhance the control performance through the continuous interaction of the parallel systems. The numerical results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the real-time smart voltage control framework of cyber-physical social power systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Solar energy exploitation has a vital role to fulfill sustainability and decrease the usage of non-renewable energy resources. Solar parabolic dish collector (SPDC) is an effective alternative to fossil fuels due to its high efficiency. Nevertheless, performance prediction, optimization, and working fluid selection of SPDCs are highly complex problems and need complicated calculations and/or costly time-consuming experiments. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms have been proven to be beneficial in modeling different solar systems. Therefore, this study proposes an improved method to predict the thermal performance parameters of SPDC with a cylindrical cavity receiver using a modified algorithm of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) integrated with equilibrium optimizer (EO). In the developed algorithm, EO is employed as a new metaheuristic approach to enhance the prediction accuracy of ANFIS via determining the optimal values of ANFIS parameters. To evaluate the performance of the developed method, ANFIS-EO is compared with ANFIS and the conventional artificial neural network. The three models were applied to compare and predict the temperature difference of working fluid, heat gain, and energy efficiency of cylindrical receiver for SPDC operating with two different solar working fluids, namely, multi-wall carbon nanotubes/thermal oil nanofluid and pure thermal oil. Moreover, five statistical criteria are utilized to evaluate the performance of the investigated algorithms. The statistical performance results showed that the ANFIS-EO technique had the best prediction accuracy among the three models, and can be regarded as a powerful optimization tool for predicting the energetic performance of SPDC. The predicted results obtained by the ANFIS-EO have an excellent determination coefficient of 0.99999 for all predicted responses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Utilizing various renewable energy resources (RERs) for powering desalination plants is an encouraging choice, specifically in arid and remote areas where conventional resources are unavailable or costly. Various RERs were used to derive desalination systems such as solar, wind, geothermal, etc. Reverse osmosis, multi-stage flash, and multi-effect distillation are the most used desalination technologies in connection with various RES. Some RES/desalination technologies combinations could be cost-efficient and reliable if appropriately designed. However, the unpredictable load demands and the intermittency nature of the RERs make designing such systems difficult. Various integrated scenarios are proposed in such systems, such as PV combinations with wind, battery energy storage systems, fuel cells, electrolyzers, etc. As a result, determining the optimum configuration using traditional methods is difficult. Implementing intelligent techniques that can integrate all working and design parameters involved in the various possible scenarios is critical for finding the optimal operating conditions. This work discusses and summarizes various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance RES-powered desalination systems. The implementation of various forecasting models, optimization algorithms, and control systems in designing and operating RER-powered desalination systems was analyzed. Finally, future research recommendations for further improving the current technology were included. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Wind speed and solar radiation are two of the most well-known and widely used renewable energy sources worldwide. Coal, natural gas, and petroleum are examples of fossil fuels that are not replenished and are thus non-renewable energy sources due to their high carbon content and the methods by which they are generated. To predict energy production of renewable sources, researchers use energy forecasting techniques based on the recent advances in machine learning approaches. Numerous prediction methods have significant drawbacks, including high computational complexity and inability to generalize for various types of sources of renewable energy sources. Methodology: In this paper, we proposed a novel approach capable of generalizing the prediction accuracy for both wind speed and solar radiation forecasting data. The proposed approach is based on a new optimization algorithm and a new stacked ensemble model. The new optimization algorithm is a hybrid of Al-Biruni Earth Radius (BER) and genetic algorithm (GA) and it is denoted by the GABER optimization algorithm. This algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the proposed stacked ensemble model to boost the prediction accuracy and to improve the generalization capability. Results: To evaluate the proposed approach, several experiments are conducted to study its effectiveness and superiority compared to other optimization methods and forecasting models. In addition, statistical tests are conducted to assess the significance and difference of the proposed approach. The recorded results proved the proposed approach’s superiority, effectiveness, generalization, and statistical significance when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: The proposed approach is capable of predicting both wind speed and solar radiation with better generalization. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - With the increasing penetration of renewable energy and flexible loads in smart grids, a more complicated power system with high uncertainty is gradually formed, which brings about great challenges to smart grid operations. Traditional optimization methods usually require accurate mathematical models and parameters and cannot deal well with the growing complexity and uncertainty. Fortunately, the widespread popularity of advanced meters makes it possible for smart grid to collect massive data, which offers opportunities for data-driven artificial intelligence methods to address the optimal operation and control issues. Therein, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has attracted extensive attention for its excellent performance in operation problems with high uncertainty. To this end, this article presents a comprehensive literature survey on DRL and its applications in smart grid operations. First, a detailed overview of DRL, from fundamental concepts to advanced models, is conducted in this article. Afterward, we review various DRL techniques as well as their extensions developed to cope with emerging issues in the smart grid, including optimal dispatch, operational control, electricity market, and other emerging areas. In addition, an application-oriented survey of DRL in smart grid is presented to identify difficulties for future research. Finally, essential challenges, potential solutions, and future research directions concerning the DRL applications in smart grid are also discussed. © 1963-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Under the background of the high percentage renewable energy access and the rapid development of multiple energy coupling networks, it is difficult for a single model-driven methodology to satisfy the speed requirements of the real-time optimal scheduling decisions for the integrated regional energy systems. Therefore, it is significant to study the scheduling decision methods with high intelligence and fast decision-making capabilities. In this paper, a data- and model-driven method for a bi-level optimal scheduling of the regional integrated energy systems is proposed. On the upper layer, the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is used to obtain a day-ahead scheduling plan which provides reference values for the within-day rolling optimization. The lower layer combines the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for the within-day rolling optimization decision making. Using the adaptive power correction model it finely tunes its outputs to obtain the accurate solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper is demonstrated by means of example analysis. © 2022 Power System Technology Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the context of both the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) and microgrid (MG), the Energy Management System (EMS) is a key decision-maker for integrating Distributed renewable Energy Resources (DERs) efficiently. The EMS is regarded as a strong enabler of providing the optimized scheduling control in operation and management of usage of disperse DERs and Renewable Energy reSources (RES) such as a small-size wind-turbine (WT) and photovoltaic (PV) energies. The main objective to be pursued by the EMS is the minimization of the overall operating cost of the MG integrated VPP network. However, the minimization of the power peaks is a new objective and open issue to a well-functional EMS, along with the maximization of profit in the energy market. Thus, both objectives have to be taken into account at the same time. Thus, this paper proposes the EMS application incorporating power offering strategy applying a nature-inspired algorithm such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, in order to find the optimal solution of the objective function in the context of the overall operating cost, the coordination of DERs, and the energy losses in a MG integrated VPP network. For a fair DERs coordination with minimized power fluctuations in the power flow, the power offering strategies with an active power control and re-distribution are proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed MG integrated VPP model with PSO-based EMS employing Egalitarian reDistribution (ED) power offering strategy is most feasible option for the overall operating cost of VPP revenue. The total operating cost of the proposed EMS with ED strategy is 40.98$ compared to 432.8$ of MGs only without EMS. It is concluded that each MGs in the proposed VPP model intelligently participates in energy trading market compliant with the objective function, to minimize the overall cost and the power fluctuation. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

AB  - Power quality is the manifestation of a disruption in the supply voltage, current, or frequency that damages the utility equipment and has become an important issue with the introduction of more sophisticated and sensitive devices. So, the supply power quality issue still remains a major challenge as its degradation can cause huge destabilization of electrical networks. As renewable energy sources have irregular nature, a microgrid essentially needs an energy storage system containing advanced power electronic converters, which is the root cause of the majority of power quality disturbances. Also, the integration of non-linear and unbalanced loads into the grid adds to its power quality problems. This article gives a compact overview of the identification, categorization, and mitigation of these power quality events in a microgrid by using various Artificial Intelligence-based techniques like Optimization techniques, Adaptive Learning techniques, Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks, and Fuzzy Logic. © 2023, Universidade do Porto - Faculdade de Engenharia.

AB  - Renewable and energy sustainable solutions are the need of the hour in this current era where energy is needed for every single and small task but energy generation resources are limited. The emergence of 6G, IoT (Internet of Things), smart technologies and AI (artificial intelligence) has made it possible to integrate renewable energy solutions to save energy and to preserve green environments by saving energy generation resources. The data are generated from diverse nodes and geographical locations in large amounts, and it is very challenging to manage the transition states of data. Optical fibers and optical channels play an important role in handling the flow of massive data. Innovative solutions are required to handle the transition of data by saving energy optimally. Energy is life, and saving energy is as important as saving life. All the newer technologies are thriving for minimal consumption of energy by exploiting smart solutions and with the advent of renewable solutions for energy generation. In many application scenarios, data must be transmitted to a sink/server within a short span of time as soon as the event takes place. An inter-hop minimal latency is required when data are transferred between hops in a green multi-hop cognitive radio network (GM-CRN), which requires innovative solutions to transmit the data over optical channels by consuming minimal energy. This article focuses on the integration of renewable energy resources in multi-hop optical channels, which not only helps save energy but also optimizes the data transmission rate, throughput and transmission latency. The management of renewable energy generation resources along with inter-hop delay is still a challenging task and this article attempts to provide a solution to address this problem. This paper suggests a mechanism that ensures minimal inter-hop delay and interference avoidance to optimize network utility. The sink allocates licensed channels to the IoT devices with energy harvesting (EH) capability for data transmission by considering the network utility, energy harvesting, and sustainability of energy. The research in this article further investigates a utility optimization and minimal delay problem, which can be decomposed into four deterministic sub-problems, i.e., the device battery management (DBM) problem, data discard control (DDC) problem, sampling rate control (SRC) problem, and interference-free channel allocation (ICA) problem with the aid of Lyapunov Optimization techniques. Finally, an efficient online algorithm is also devised to optimize the network utility by minimal allocation of power to sink nodes without hampering the data transmission speed on optical channels. The results of the proposed mechanism are evaluated by using the standard statistical parameters in a simulated environment, and the proposed mechanism is compared with state-of-the-art techniques to assess the viability of the proposed approach for advanced optical technologies (AOT). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Carbon-neutrality transition in building sectors requires combinations of renewable systems and artificial intelligence (AI) for robustness, reliability, automation, and flexibility. In this study, a comprehensive review on AI applications in renewable systems, have been conducted, to report the current progress, tendency and challenges. Underlying learning mechanisms of AI-based various applications have been studied, in terms of modelling techniques on solar power forecasting, multi-level stochastic uncertainty analysis, smart controls, fault detection and diagnosis, single and multi-objective optimisations and intelligent buildings.

AB  - Steel industry contributes significantly to the world economy, but is highly energy intensive and CO2 intensive since the coal-based blast furnace route is dominant in steelmaking. Besides efficient utilization of the steel mill gases for power and heat supply, deploying technologies of carbon capture, utilization and renewable power is in urgent need for the transition of the steel industry towards carbon neutrality. To attain this goal, this paper develops a low-carbon steel mill gas utilization system with the integration of solvent-based carbon capture, methanol production based carbon utilization and renewable power. An artificial intelligent based optimal scheduling is then proposed to coordinate the interactions among gas, heat, electricity and carbon under variant weather and load conditions. Gradient boosted regression trees with Bayesian optimization is exploited to identify efficient surrogate models for the complex devices within the system. Heuristic search algorithm of particle swarm optimization is applied to find the low-carbon and economical scheduling within the entire scheduling period. Case studies show that the optimal scheduling can unlock complementary advantages among renewable energy, carbon capture and utilization, leading to 97% renewable energy curtailment reduction, 62% CO2 emission reduction and 126 tons of methanol production in 24 h. Sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate the effects of additional coal consumption, renewable power installed capacity, CO2 emission penalty coefficient and CO2 capture constraint mode, providing broader insight into the operation of the steel mill gas utilization system towards carbon neutrality. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Two modern methods of the energy management system (EMS) based on a modified cost function are addressed in this paper. Fuzzy logic (FL) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) is implemented to achieve the optimal performance of seawater desalination plants (SWDP) within the minimum feed-in tariff (FiT). The technical difficulties involved in the variation of energy price from one time to another and the system parameters uncertainties. For example, the price of energy is higher at the peak time and the price is lower at normal times. Also, the peak time can change from one day to another day. The proposed management system can deal with these variations and uncertainty cases. The suggested EMS is achieved through a bidirectional electrical energy interchange approach ( pi -EEIA). The main concept behind the proposed pi -EEIA is how and when to inject the excess generated energy of renewable energy into the utility grid or charge the battery depending on the minimum dynamic cost criterion and vice versa. To accomplish this study a 700 m3/day SWDP located in Egypt fed on solar energy and a utility network has been constructed and analyzed. The system includes SWDP fed from a photovoltaic (PV) array as well as the utility grid in addition to a battery energy storage system (BESS). The main objective of this study is the management and coordination between the energy exchange process from the solar energy, the utility network, and BESS to provide sufficient electrical energy for SWDP within the minimum FiT. The system is constructed and validated using the MATLAB/SIMULINK™ software package. The proposed FL and HHO-based EMSs are investigated in the presence of the system uncertainties such as the change in the energy (excess or shortage) as well as the change in the energy price in the utility network (high or low) with (normal or peak) time. The attained results demonstrate that the proposed FL and HHO-based EMSs provide high dynamic performance and accurate coordination between various energy resources and BESS. The results show that FL-based EMS achieves a profit of 10.28 but the HHO-based EMS achieves a profit of 10.11 in the same period.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Wind energy is becoming increasingly competitive and promising for renewable energy profiles. Accurate and reliable wind speed prediction is crucial for the effective exploitation of wind energy. However, previous studies have generally ignored the importance of capturing both linear and non-linear wind speed characteristics and selecting forecasting sub-models objectively, resulting in poor forecasting performance. To bridge these gaps, a novel ensemble forecasting system is proposed by integrating the decomposition strategy, sub-model selection, and ensemble point and interval prediction based on the newly proposed multi-objective Archimedes optimization algorithm, which has been demonstrated to be effective at the theoretical and empirical levels for providing reliable wind speed forecasting results. Based on hourly-resolution wind speed data from three datasets of Shandong Peninsula, China, three experiments and discussions are conducted.

AB  - Because of environmental issues and energy crises, significant attention has been received in the domain of renewable and clean energy systems. Solar energy is the most effective source of renewable energy technologies. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) system have become common in grid-linked applications and plays a vital part in power production. MPPT algorithms enable PV systems to capture the maximum available power from the solar panels, regardless of variations in solar irradiance, temperature, and other environmental factors. By continuously tracking the MPP, MPPT techniques ensure that the PV system operates at its highest efficiency, resulting in increased energy harvesting and improved overall performance. Meanwhile, the frequent modifications in irradiance and temperature pose a major challenging issue which can be resolved by the use of artificial intelligence MPPT methodologies like artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic (FL), and metaheuristics systems. In this aspect, this work presents a new quasi-oppositional artificial algae optimization (QOAAO) with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique, named QOAAO-ANFIS for maximum efficiency MPPT technique for minimizing the present ripple and power oscillations over the MPP. The presented QOAAO-ANFIS model mainly depends upon the integration of the ANFIS and QOHOA techniques. In addition, the presented QOAAO-ANFIS model involves optimal MF selection of the ANFIS model to estimate the irradiation level and compute PV voltage equivalent to maximal power point. The QOAAO model can be utilized for enhancing the optimization process of membership function variables under varying conditions and awareness of global optima. The simulation result analysis of the QOAAO-ANFIS model takes place in terms of different evaluation measures. Extensive comparative results reported the better performance of the QOAAO-ANFIS model with maximum tracking efficiency of 99.89% and a minimum convergence time of 13.51ms.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

AB  - The pressure retarded osmosis process is emerging as one of the most promising technologies for extracting renewable energy from salinity gradient resources. The hybrid system of the pressure retarded osmosis and photovoltaic/thermal systems is capable of effectively improving overall energy efficiency. The prime research focus of hybrid energy systems is to produce environment-friendly solutions by minimizing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency. Due to the increasing demand for intelligent computing, the challenges of maximum power extraction and efficient energy management have attracted the attention of researchers around the world. Thus, a Honey Badger Approach based energy management strategy is proposed to solve the problem of performance enhancement in the pressure retarded osmosis and photovoltaic/thermal system by maximizing the multi-variable functions. The Honey badger approach uses global sight to tackle the optimization of multiple objectives and to achieve optimal solutions. The proposed energy management method is tested with various types of operational environments, including variations in the operational temperature, solar irradiance and ambient temperature in regard to detrimental effects. The practical hourly data of Perth for a year is utilized to simulate the actual operating conditions. The simulation results indicate that the proposed energy management method overwhelms other competing approaches with better energy efficiency, thereby ensuring the continuity of energy supply and improving the reliability of the system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The usual operation of a microgrid (MG) may often be challenged by emergencies related to extreme weather conditions and technical issues. As a result, the operator often needs to adapt the MG’s management by either: (i) excluding disconnected components, (ii) switching to islanded mode or (iii) performing a black start, which is required in case of a blackout, followed by either direct reconnection to the main grid or islanded operation. The purpose of this paper is to present an optimal Decision Support System (DSS) that assists the MG’s operator in all the main possible sorts of emergencies, thus providing an inclusive solution. The objective of the optimizer, developed in Pyomo, is to maximize the autonomy of the MG, prioritizing its renewable production. Therefore, the DSS is in line with the purpose of the ongoing energy transition. Furthermore, it is capable of taking into account multiple sorts of Distributed Energy Resources (DER), including Renewable Energy Sources (RES), Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)—which can only be charged with renewable energy—and local, fuel-based generators. The proposed DSS is applied in a number of emergencies considering grid-forming and grid-following mode, in order to highlight its effectiveness and is verified with the use of PowerFactory, DIgSILENT. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper proposes a new artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA)-based framework to investigate the optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problem which is a critical problem in the capacity of power systems. This paper aims to improve the performance of power systems by minimizing two distinct objective functions namely active power loss in the transmission network and total voltage deviation at the load buses subjected to various constraints within multiobjective framework. The proposed AHA-based framework maps the inherent flight and foraging capabilities exhibited by hummingbirds in nature to determine the best settings for the control variables (i.e., voltages at generation buses, the tap positions of on-load tap-changing transformers (OLTCs) and the size of switchable shunt VAR compensators) to minimize the overall objective functions. A multiobjective optimal reactive power dispatch framework (MO-ORPD) considering renewable energy sources (RES) and load uncertainties is also proposed to minimize the individual objectives simultaneously. The competency and robustness of the proposed AHA-based framework is validated and tested on IEEE 14 bus and IEEE 39 bus test systems to solve the ORPD problem. Eventually, the results are compared with other well-known optimization techniques in the literature. Box plots and statistical tests using SPSS are performed and validated to justify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The paper proposes a hybrid microgrid (HMG) system with solar modules and wind turbines as primary energy sources and a diesel engine as backup. Meanwhile, the hydrogen energy storage system (HySS) is utilized as energy storage. Firstly, by reducing the levelized cost of energy (COE), this study presents the optimal size and configuration of various renewable and distributed energy resources in HMG systems. Secondly, two novel modified hybridized particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) are developed, namely, ACO initialized PSO and ACO updated PSO. The optimal simulation results using PSO and ACO metaheuristic technique either individually or hybridized are compared in terms of primarily minimizing the levelized COE and achieving short execution time. Thirdly, to verify the geographical-independency of the integration of HySS for producing onsite green hydrogen locally, the estimation performance is examined for three different locations in Egypt, Mozambique and Denmark respectively using hourly meteorological and load data in 2019. Sensitivity and effectiveness analysis are carried out to highlight the major parameters that impact HySS incorporation. Finally, the system readiness level together with the different hydrogen, economy barriers constraints, limitations and risks are investigated based on the technology readiness level and the integration readiness level indices. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the ACO updated PSO optimization algorithm towards minimizing the levelized COE in the different regions. In the developing countries, the salvage market supports HySS integration. At system readiness levels range between 0.65 and 0.94, versatile HySS integration is verified. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The optimization problem is one of the most common problems in the power system field, and most engineering problems can be attributed to optimization problems. In order to solve these optimization problems, various optimization algorithms have been proposed. However, with the rapid improvement of human needs and highly renewable energy penetrations, highly complex optimization problems appear constantly, making the traditional optimization algorithm challenging to meet the needs in accuracy and speed. In recent years, the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence (AI) has created a new opportunity to upgrade optimization algorithms. Smart grid is the future development direction of the power grid, which has high demand in security, stability, reliability, elasticity, sustainability, and efficiency. Due to these requirements, smart grid is a highly complex optimization problem with multiple objectives and constraints, in which the most typical problem is power flow control. Many researchers have been committed to solving various power flow control problems, whether using traditional or modern AI optimization algorithms. This paper aims to give a comprehensive and clear picture of recent advances in this research area. First, the evolution process, classification, and state-of-the-art methodologies of optimization algorithms are introduce. Then, a comprehensive review of traditional and modern AI optimization applications to control solvability, power and frequency, voltage, security, and stability is given. These applications have achieved good performance. Nevertheless, some critical challenges in efficiency, interpretability, transferability, stability, economy, and robustness are put forward. To overcome these challenges, critical potential directions in future research to make modern AI optimization more suitable for practical engineering are given. © 2023 Chin.Soc.for Elec.Eng.

AB  - The different energy assets such as solar panels and batteries help electrical engineers to manage and meet the increasing demand. The amalgamation of renewable energy resources with artificial intelligence is the key focus of providing high energy efficiency with alternative sources. This solution will not only meet electricity demand but also help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions as a result the efficient, sustainable and eco-friendly solution can be achieved which would contribute a lot to the smart grid environment. Here, a modified grey wolf optimizer approach is utilized to develop a novel energy management system for SPV-based microgrid considering modern power grid interactions. The proposed approach aims to provide a proficient microgrid that utilizes solar photovoltaic technology, and energy storage systems using an artificial intelligence algorithm-based microgrid control for optimal dispatch of energy in grid-connected systems. The performance of this novel energy management system is validated under sunny day and cloudy day, to emulate the stochastic nature of solar photovoltaic systems. A comparative study with mixed linear programming is also conducted that indicates towards the savings in 23.34% and 45.55% of the rolling cost for a clear and cloudy day respectively. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The real-time electrical equipment management, such as renewable energy, controllable loads, and storage units, plays a key role in low-carbon operation of smart industrial park. Digital twin (DT), which explores cloud-edge-device collaboration and artificial intelligence to establish accurate digital representation of physical equipment, is a cutting-edge technology to realize intelligent optimization of electrical equipment management. However, the practical implementation still faces reliability and communication efficiency problems, such as adverse impact of electromagnetic interference on DT reliability, high communication cost of DT model training, and uncoordinated resource allocation among cloud, edge, and device layers. We propose a Cloud-edge-device Collaborative reliable and Communication-efficient DT for lOW-carbon electrical equipment management named $\text{C}^{3}$-FLOW. It minimizes the long-term global loss function and time-average communication cost by jointly optimizing device scheduling, channel allocation, and computational resource allocation. Simulation results verify that $\text{C}^{3}$-FLOW performs superior in loss function, communication efficiency, and carbon emission reduction.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The replacement of fossil energy with renewable energy is a powerful measure to achieve the peak carbon and carbon neutrality. The impact of volatility caused by the large-scale wind power integration should be reduced, and the transmission network structure around the integrate point needs to be reasonably optimized to ensure the stability of the system under any uncertain scenarios. In this paper, the artificial intelligence technology is used to propose a deep reinforcement learning transmission network structure optimization that considers the reliability and economy of the wind farm integration. First, the K-electrical betweenness entropy balance that considers the output volatility of the large-capacity wind farms is proposed to evaluate the equilibrium degree of the power flow in the vicinity of a wind farm. Secondly, an interactive reinforcement learning model for the optimization of transmission network structure is constructed from the perspective of Markov decision-making. Finally, the DDQN algorithm is adopted in the improved IEEE RTS 24 system to solve the optimization of the transmission network structure in the wind power replacing the integration, which verified the superiority and effectiveness of the method. © 2022, Power System Technology Press.

AB  - Building a new power system is one of the main measures to achieve the "carbon peak and carbon neutrality" strategic goal. Wind power and photovoltaic power generation are the most representative renewable energy, and their volatility and randomness have brought major challenges to grid security and renewable energy consumption; while renewable energy power prediction is the key technology to reduce its random impact. In recent years, with the successful application of big data technology and the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology represented by deep learning and reinforcement learning in many fields, its application in renewable energy power forecasting is still in the ascendant. This paper first briefly discusses the theoretical basis of AI technology in the application of renewable energy power forecasting, and systematically summarizes the application of AI technology in wind power and photovoltaic power forecasting, including the application of various data processing technologies such as data enhancement and feature construction, application of traditional machine learning, deep learning, combined algorithms in model construction, the application of evolutionary algorithm, swarm intelligence optimization, reinforcement learning, and other intelligent optimization algorithms in model training and hyperparameter optimization. Then, the current related literature is statistically analyzed. Based on the results of the renewable energy forecasting contest as well as the actual forecasting system research situation, the current academic research hotspots and trends, and the application of industrial models are compared and analyzed. Finally, some problems existing in the current renewable energy power forecasting in scene adaptation few-shot learning, numerical weather prediction (NWP) data spatio-temporal resolution, distributed renewable energy prediction, etc. are analyzed, and the prospects of a variety of AI technologies such as reinforcement learning, meta-learning, graph neural network(GNN), to solve related problems are prospected. © 2023 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

AB  - This paper investigates the smart energy management of a building using artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time data. The proposed method uses a stochastic structure including the point estimate method and grey wolf optimization (GWO) to provide a suitable scheduling program for a renewable based building. Moreover, a correction approach is developed to improve the search ability of the GWO. Different renewable sources of photovoltaics and wind turbine are considered for the power supply to the building. Considering the big size of the unit, two gas turbines are also incorporated to help emergency support of the building. The output power of the renewable energy sources are forecasted using the support vector machine (SVM) to have an accurate and reliable analysis. Considering the high uncertainty effects, point estimate method is a suitable method for handling the forecast errors. Two different scenarios are simulated to check the energy management problem in the normal and emergency cases in the building. The model is validated using a typical building test system. © 2022

AB  - Presently, there is mounting pressure to decarbonize the power grid via the use of renewable energy (RE) sources. However, most of these sources could perhaps not easily replace conventional power plants due to the fact that they have nonlinear characteristics, and most of these issues still need to be resolved. In order to effectively manage the non-linearity of some RE sources and improve the energy harvesting capability of these systems, various methods have been adopted. Some of these techniques have one or more objective functions and commonly use commercial packages to minimize system cost and improve output power simultaneously. Rural electrification is still pitiably prohibitive, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and off-grid RE technologies remain a reliable way of meeting rural electricity needs. Exploiting these sources could help offset rural electricity demand sustainably while mitigating the negative impacts of using a diesel generator and other sources that are not environmentally friendly. This study reviews issues regarding the hybrid RE system design with insights on the most often conflicting constraints. Also highlighted are the recent trends in hybrid system optimization with RE technologies and the various considerations scholars use in hybrid applications. Moreover, the study has discussed the essential aspects of evaluating the performance of a hybrid RE system and its applicability in rural electrification. The study has explored various methods and concludes that hybrid techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) offer better performance for system optimization. © 2022 Seventh Sense Research Group®

AB  - Marine ports operations are often associated with a variety of externalities, including issues like air pollution and noise, among others; there is clearly a negative impact on the working environment and the quality of life of the citizens living next to a port. An effective way to improve the overall situation can be provided by deploying the shore-to-ship electrification method, also known as Cold Ironing. Unfortunately, there is still a disadvantage: there is no holistic approach involved, as the external electrical grid is usually powered by fossil fuels. In a different approach, the zero-emissions port concept uses a smart grid technology framework connected to renewable energy sources and the electrical grid is used only as a backup source in a situation where there is a deficit in power balance. However, an important challenge remains, the conversion to electricity and the efficiency of the converting systems. The use of such sources for commercial electrical supply is only possible with the new “Smart Grid” concept and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, an overview of AI methods for smart grid energy management optimization for ports is presented, discussing the potential application of each algorithm to zero-emission port concepts. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - In the electric network, integration of renewable energy sources and switching in large industrial loads and non-linear loads result in Power Quality Disturbances (PQDs). PQDs arise malfunctioning the sensitive equipment integrated with power grid; therefore, it is necessary to overcome the effects of poor power quality (PQ) in electric power supply. It is possible to monitor PQ with the advancement of signal processing and artificial intelligence automatically. In this paper, techniques of automatic detection and classification of PQDs are proposed using discrete wavelet transform–multi-resolution analysis (DWT–MRA) and evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms in renewable integrated power grid. Fit k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier along with DWT–MRA technique is used to classify the PQDs and it is optimized using evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms like, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and grey wolf optimization. Performance of algorithm is compared using accuracy of classification and confusion matrix. Further robustness of classifier is tested with Simulink model of IEEE bus test system that indicated the renewable integrated power grid environment. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Roadside units (RSUs) play an important role in the request fulfillment of vehicles. In rural areas, RSUs are powered by renewable energy sources like solar energy. Hence, the request fulfillment of vehicles must be done in such a way that the energy consumption across RSUs is minimized. The requests are categorized into traditional application (low computation) requests and smart application (high computation) requests. To avoid excessive computation at RSUs, low computation requests are scheduled across RSUs while high computation requests are scheduled across fog servers for processing. In this paper, we propose an online energy-efficient Inter-RSU Scheduling Algorithm (ee-IRSA) and a distributed Ant Colony Optimization-based Load balancing technique (d-ACOL) for optimizing the request fulfillment of traditional and smart application requests, respectively. ee-IRSA ensures minimum and uniform energy consumption across RSUs while d-ACOL ensures minimum queue waiting time of requests across fog servers. In addition, a second-price auction game-based relay vehicle selection technique is proposed which further minimizes the energy consumption of RSUs. Simulation results show that ee-IRSA with relay vehicle selection reduces the energy consumption by 33 % , and d-ACOL reduces the queue waiting time by an average of 48 % as compared to other load balancing techniques. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - A smart energy management controller can improve energy efficiency, save energy costs, and reduce carbon emissions and energy consumption while accurately catering to consumer consumption habits. Having integrated various renewable energy systems (RESs) and a battery storage system (BSS), we proposed an optimization-based demand-side management (DSM) scheduler and energy management controller (SEMC) for a smart home. The suggested SEMC creates a DSM-based operational plan regarding user-centered and comfort-aware preferences. Using the generated appliances operation plan, consumers can reduce energy costs, carbon emissions, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), improve their comfort in terms of thermal, illumination, and appliances usage preferences. A schedule for residential consumers is suggested using ant colony optimization (ACO), teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), Jaya algorithm, rainfall algorithm, firefly algorithm, and our hybrid ACO and TLBO optimization (ACTLBO) algorithm. Five existing algorithms-based frameworks validate the DSM framework that relies on ACTLBO. The results validate that the integration of RESs and BSS, and adapting our proposed algorithm and SEMC under demand response program real-time price reduced the energy bill costs, PAR and CO2 in Case I: only external grid (EG) usage by 42.14%, 22.05%, and 28.33%, in Case II: EG with RESs by 21.79%, 11.27%, 17.02%, and in Case III: EG with RESs and BSS by 28.76%, 41.53%, 21.86%, respectively as compared to without employing SEMC. Moreover, the user-comfort (UC) improvement index-ratio with scheduling using ACTLBO is 7.77%, 24.73%, 5.00%, and 3.43% in aspects of indoor air quality, average delay, thermal, and visual, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed DSM-based framework outperforms existing frameworks to reduce energy cost, reduce carbon emission, mitigate peak loads, and improve UC.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The use of green hydrogen as a fuel source for marine applications has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the industry. The development of a sustainable and cost-effective method for producing green hydrogen has gained a lot of attention. Water electrolysis is the best and most environmentally friendly method for producing green hydrogen-based renewable energy. Therefore, identifying the ideal operating parameters of the water electrolysis process is critical to hydrogen production. Three controlling factors must be appropriately identified to boost hydrogen generation, namely electrolysis time (min), electric voltage (V), and catalyst amount (μg). The proposed methodology contains the following two phases: modeling and optimization. Initially, a robust model of the water electrolysis process in terms of controlling factors was established using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based on the experimental dataset. After that, a modern pelican optimization algorithm (POA) was employed to identify the ideal parameters of electrolysis duration, electric voltage, and catalyst amount to enhance hydrogen production. Compared to the measured datasets and response surface methodology (RSM), the integration of ANFIS and POA improved the generated hydrogen by around 1.3% and 1.7%, respectively. Overall, this study highlights the potential of ANFIS modeling and optimal parameter identification in optimizing the performance of solar-powered water electrocatalysis systems for green hydrogen production in marine applications. This research could pave the way for the more widespread adoption of this technology in the marine industry, which would help to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint and promote sustainability. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The rising levels of global warming in the environment owing to emissions from fossil-fuel-based engines has increased the search for efficient clean energy systems. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) standout as a promising energy conversion device which can directly convert heat to electricity. Several optimization studies have been carried out on these devices to improve their power generation rate and efficiencies while guaranteeing long lifespan. However, the limitations of finite element methods (FEMs) in easily providing optimization guidelines at a fast rate has hindered the manufacture of TEGs with high thermo-mechanical performance. This is why this paper presents the first ever artificial intelligence enabled optimization of a TEG conducted via deep neural networks (DNNs). Previous research on this topic completely neglected the mechanical performance and consequently, the service lifetime of the TEG when exposed to thermal operating conditions. To fill this gap, the effects of strategic parameters on the power output, efficiency and thermal stress performances of the TEG are investigated. These parameters are the hot and cold junction temperatures/heat transfer coefficients, incident heat flux, external load resistance, TE leg height, area, and area ratio. The DNN is fed with verified three-dimensional FEM simulations carried out on the ANSYS Workbench platform. The FEM results exhibit almost perfect correlation with experimental data which establishes the precision of the model. Results are that the DNN model is able to provide the necessary optimization guidelines for maximum thermo-mechanical performance in just 8 seconds compared to the 8 hours required by the FEM. The TEGs that were modelled using the DNN optimization guidelines improved the power, efficiency and mechanical performance of the unoptimized TEG by 11.94%, 14.17%, and 91%, respectively. These results are sufficient to provide useful guidelines at a fast rate for the fabrication of high-efficiency TEGs that will operate for a long time. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The energy hub has gained a lot of importance as a way to optimize multicarrier energy infrastructure to enhance its flexibility and proficiency. In the presence of energy storage in energy hubs, it is possible to efficiently coordinate energy supply and demand while taking advantage of changing energy tariffs and local renewable energy supply sources. In this article, we propose a novel method based on gray wolf optimization (GWO), which breaks down the complex optimization problem into subproblems, including the storage scheduling and another part in the grid, and comes up with the respective solutions via GWO and interior point. As a result, the proposed method avoids the drawbacks of numerical ways and artificial intelligence techniques, which tend to converge only to a local minimum or require heavy computational times. Furthermore, the article proposes a multilayer cloud computing framework for optimally scheduling energy hubs. The present study applies the new technique to a two-hub and three-hub system during 24 h. The approach is also examined in the context of an 11-hub system to investigate the efficiency and potential applications. The outcomes prove that the approach can achieve a very near-global point, which is confirmed through an analytical method, as well as being rapid sufficient to permit for online implementations with receding time horizons.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, renewable energy (RE) has become popular due to its benefits, such as being inexpensive, low-carbon, ecologically friendly, steady, and reliable. The RE sources are gradually combined with non-renewable energy (NRE) sources into electric grids to satisfy energy demands. Since energy utilization is highly related to national energy policy, energy prediction using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) based models can be employed for energy prediction on RE and NRE power resources. Predicting energy consumption of RE and NRE sources using effective models becomes necessary.With this motivation, this study presents a new multimodal fusionbased predictive tool for energy consumption prediction (MDLFM-ECP) of RE and NRE power sources. Actual data may influence the prediction performance of the results in prediction approaches. The proposed MDLFMECP technique involves pre-processing, fusion-based prediction, and hyperparameter optimization. In addition, the MDLFM-ECP technique involves the fusion of four deep learning (DL) models, namely long short-termmemory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), deep belief network (DBN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Moreover, the chaotic cat swarm optimization (CCSO) algorithm is applied to tune the hyperparameters of the DL models. The design of the CCSO algorithm for optimal hyperparameter tuning of the DL models, showing the novelty of the work. A series of simulations took place to validate the superior performance of the proposed method, and the simulation outcome emphasized the improved results of the MDLFM-ECP technique over the recent approaches with minimum overall mean absolute percentage error of 3.58%. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

AB  - The distributed controllable loads (DCLs) are employed to achieve energy management for hybrid renewable energy-based multi-area power systems (HREPSs). The DCLs are suggested as a cheaper solution instead of the expensive energy storage systems. Due to the nonlinearity, high variability and uncertain nature of HREPSs based on DCLs, the need for an artificial intelligence-based nonlinear energy management system becomes mandatory. This paper suggests a hybrid control methodology based on fuzzy logic and nonlinear sliding mode control (FL-NLSM) to manage the energy of DCLs in a smart grid. The proposed hybrid control strategy merges the unique properties of both FL and NLSM to handle the system nonlinearities and to improve the damping characteristics of the system response against the uncertainties of the parameters; as well as the high variability of renewable energy resources such as wind power and the load demand fluctuations. Moreover, the gains of the proposed FL-NLSM controller are optimized by the imperialist competitive algorithm that is considered a powerful artificial intelligent technique. The modified benchmark IEEE-39 bus test system is utilized to accomplish this study. The output results confirm that the proposed FL-NLSM can diminish the deviations of the system frequency and tie-line power between different areas effectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Deep neural networks have been regarded as accurate models to predict complex fermentation processes due to their capacity to learn from a high number of data sets via artificial intelligence. To enhance the performance of these models the main challenge is to select the appropriate hyperparameters, such as neural network architecture (number of hidden layers and hidden units), activation function, optimizer, learning rate, and others. This study aims to use a hybrid Bayesian optimization with tree-structured Parzen estimator (BO-TPE) to predict biogas production from real wastewater treatment plant data using deep neural network machine learning (DNN) with optimized hyperparameters. Due to the high number of missing sample measurement records, the data preprocessing process has been performed in three sequential steps: the first step is to remove columns with a high percentage of missing values. The second step concerns removing rows with a high number of missing values. The remaining missing values in the dataset were removed in the third step using the dropna function from Pandas' library. Then, on the remaining data, three normalization techniques (MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, and StandardScaler) were used for 16 relevant features of the anaerobic digestion process (AD) and compared with Non-Normalized data. The RobustScaler technique demonstrated good prediction capabilities of biogas volume produced. The maximum predicted volume was 2236.105 Nm3/d, with the coefficient of determination (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.712, 164.610, and 223.429, respectively. This value remains slightly higher than the actual biogas volume produced in the wastewater treatment plant, which was 2131 Nm3/d. Adopting StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and Non-Normalized data provided statistical performance indicator values of (0.690; 170.518; 231.519), (0.679; 180.575; 235.648), and (0.647; 183.403; 247.203), respectively. These findings offer an autonomous strategy to monitor the effective operational variables of a large-scale digester, ensuring the stability of the complex fermentation process as well as the long-term sustainability and economic viability of the renewable energy approach in the sector of waste treatment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The adoption of grid-connected electric vehicles (GEVs) brings a bright prospect for promoting renewable energy. An efficient vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling scheme that can deal with renewable energy volatility and protect vehicle batteries from fast aging is indispensable to enable this benefit. This article develops a novel V2G scheduling method for consuming local renewable energy in microgrids by using a mixed learning framework. It is the first attempt to integrate battery protective targets in GEVs charging management in renewable energy systems. Battery safeguard strategies are derived via an offline soft-run scheduling process, where V2G management is modeled as a constrained optimization problem based on estimated microgrid and GEVs states. Meanwhile, an online V2G regulator is built to facilitate the real-time scheduling of GEVs' charging. The extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is used to train the established online regulator by learning rules from soft-run strategies. The online charging coordination of GEVs is realized by the ELM regulator based on real-time sampled microgrid frequency. The effectiveness of the developed models is verified on a U.K. microgrid with actual energy generation and consumption data. This article can effectively enable V2G to promote local renewable energy with battery aging mitigated, thus economically benefiting EV owns and microgrid operators, and facilitating decarbonization at low costs.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The continuous rise in demand for power supply has made researchers and power system engineers seek alternatives through renewable energy sources to complement the power supply in the power system grid. Wind energy conversion system (WECS) which is the means of harnessing power generation through wind is reportedly one of the most widely installed renewable alternative sources globally. Integrating WECS into the conventional power system grid results in a complex power system grid. Thus, during a disturbance or a fault period on the grid, if proper control measures are not put in place, power system instability due to power system oscillations arises. One such control measure is the damping controller which is coupled to the generating plant through its excitation system. Damping controllers help to dampen power system oscillations, but due to the dynamic nature of the power system and uncertainties inherent in a wind-integrated power grid system, fixed damping controller parameters cannot effectively dampen power system oscillations. Hence, damping controller design becomes an optimization problem. This research reviews damping controller design in a wind-integrated system using optimization techniques. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Solar photovoltaic and wind power systems are very much dependent on climate variations. Wind and solar photovoltaic systems are unreliable without storage units like batteries and diesel generators as a backup. The addition of storage devices increases the reliability of the hybrid system consisting of solar photovoltaic and wind turbines. During cloudy and slow windy days, sufficient battery bank capacity is required to meet the load demand. This review paper gives new ways of hybrid energy generation. It discusses several optimization approaches and ideas for hybrid networks. Hybrid systems are gaining more popularity and fame in the current energy crisis scenario and environmental pollution. This research has provided a comprehensive assessment of existing optimization strategies, particularly those associated with the isolated microgrid in the literature. Artificial intelligence offers noteworthy optimization for microgrid operation without long-term weather data, as evidenced by the current optimization pattern for hybrid renewable sources. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) systems are a popular renewable energy source globally, owing to their beneficial environmental and economic properties. However, their efficiency is impacted by various environmental and weather conditions, including dust accumulation, which harms the performance of solar cells, particularly in hot and dry regions. Several researchers have studied how to clean and minimize dust on PV modules. This paper reviews recent studies on the effects of dust on PV systems and effective cleaning methods. Some locations experience power losses of over 1% each day and 80% monthly efficiency reduction due to dust, which is substantial. This paper delivers a thorough review of the issue of dust on PV modules. It analyzes previous research on how photovoltaic (PV) systems function when exposed to a mix of dust accumulation and other environmental factors. It also delves into the development of models to forecast dust accumulation. Furthermore, it examines various aspects of PV module design, including the frequency of cleaning methods, economic factors, and their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, the study identifies several research gaps that require further exploration. These gaps include developing artificial intelligence-based models for reducing dust accumulation, dynamic optimization models for cleaning schedules, as well as advanced techniques for predicting dust accumulation, taking into account environmental conditions and ageing procedures. This information is essential for engineers, designers, and researchers who work on PV systems. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Microbial fuel cells have recently received considerable attention as a potential source of renewable energy. Due to its complex and hybrid nature, it has significant nonlinear features and substantial hysteresis behavior, making it hard to optimize and control its power generation directly. This study modeled power density and COD removal using random forest regression and gradient boost regression trees. System inputs are three key parameters that affect performance and commercialization. There is a range of 0.1–0.5 mg/cm2 of Pt, a degree of sulfonation of sulfonated polyether-etherketone varying from 20% to 80%, and a cathode aeration rate of 10–150 mL/min. Based on the model’s accuracies, gradient boost regression was selected for power density prediction and random forest for COD removal prediction. Particle swarm optimization was used as the optimization algorithm after selecting the best models to maximize COD removal and power density. It was found that DS was the most critical parameter for COD removal, and Pt was the most critical parameter for power density. There is a different optimal input value for each model. In order to maximize power density, DS (%) must be 67.7087, Pt (mg/cm2) must be 0.3943, and Aeration (mL/min) must be 117.7192. To maximize COD removal, the DS (%) must be 75.8816, the Pt (mg/cm2) must be 0.3322, and the Aeration (mL/min) must be 75.1933. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The large consumption of electricity worldwide has an impact on the environment which can be said to alter climate change, the degradation of the ozone layer and acid rain. A house has an average daily consumption of 270 kWh, this is why solar panels are very useful and can help to have a renewable energy at low costs. To create an intelligent photovoltaic system, different electronic sensors can be applied to the sunlight through a series of instructions in some programming software. The article proposes to prototype an intelligent photovoltaic system, based on artificial intelligence with a neural network library “propet” having a positive impact on the optimization of power generation by allowing a more accurate tracking of the sun and a greater collection of photovoltaic energy throughout the day. Performing an integration between Arduino and machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks in prediction of time series. Different practical experiments were performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract: Demand-side management (DSM) segregates the elastic and inelastic loads and restructures the load demand model of a distribution system by minimizing the operational cost of the entire process. This is done by optimally transferring the flexible loads to hours when the per-unit cost of utility is lower. This paper performs a bi-level optimization strategy to lower the operating expense of a low-voltage microgrid (LV MG) system operating in grid-connected mode, comprising battery energy storage (BES), renewable energy sources (RES), and fossil fuel-powered generators. In the first level of optimization, the load model is restructured as per the DSM participation level. Thereafter, the restructured load demand model is considered, and optimal allocation for distributed generators (DGs) is percolated for minimizing the generation cost of the microgrid system in the second level. A recently developed hybrid swarm intelligence algorithm that has already been used in solving diverse power system optimization problems was used as the optimization tool for the study. The generation cost was minimized for different grid participation types and grid pricing strategies with and without consideration of DSM. The numerical results show a 55–75% reduction in generation cost when 20–30% DSM participation was considered. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] Highlights: i.The generation cost of an LV microgrid (MG) system was evaluated for diverse grid-dependent scenarios.ii.The impact of demand-side management on the performance of the MG system and generation costs was studied. Discussion: The work described in this paper initially restructured the forecasted load demand for different DSM participation levels to reduce the peak demand and improve the load factor of the MG system. Thereafter, the generation costs were evaluated for diverse grid-dependent scenarios and compared for various load demand models obtained after DSM implementation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Materials Research Society.

AB  - Deployment of photovoltaic (PV) systems has recently been encouraged for large-scale and small-scale businesses in order to meet the global green energy targets. However, one of the most significant hurdles that limits the spread of PV applications is the dust accumulated on the PV panels’ surfaces, especially in desert regions. Numerous studies sought the use of cameras, sensors, power datasets, and other detection elements to detect the dust on PV panels; however, these methods pose more maintenance, accuracy, and economic challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent system to detect the dust level on the PV panels to optimally operate the attached dust cleaning units (DCUs). Unlike previous strategies, this study utilizes the expanded knowledge and collected data for solar irradiation and PV-generated power, along with the forecasted ambient temperature. An expert artificial intelligence (AI) computational system, adopted with the MATLAB platform, is utilized for a high level of data prediction and processing. The AI was used in this study in order to estimate the unprovided information, emulate the provided measurements, and accommodate more input/output data. The feasibility of the proposed system is investigated using actual field data during all possible weather conditions. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - Hydraulic turbines constitute an essential component within the hydroelectric power generation industry, contributing to renewable energy production with minimal environmental pollution. Maintaining stable turbine operation presents a considerable challenge, which necessitates effective fault diagnosis and warning systems. Timely and efficient fault w arnings are particularly vital, as they enable personnel to address emerging issues promptly. Although backpropagation (BP) networks are frequently employed in fault warning systems, they exhibit several limitations, such as susceptibility to local optima. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces an improved social engineering optimizer (ISEO) method aimed at optimizing BP networks for developing a hydraulic turbine warning system. Experimental results reveal that the ISEO-BP-based approach offers a highly effective fault warning system, as evidenced by superior performance metrics when compared to alternative methods. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Geothermal energy-driven systems with integrated waste heat recovery units such as the use of fuel cells and thermoelectric module can help to improve the renewable energy contribution in the energy mix. Data-driven optimization can improve their economic and environmental performance and their macro-projection can help in the achievement of net-zero plans. This article extends the use of a framework containing the usage of data modeling and artificial intelligence to conduct different optimization scenarios of the geothermal-driven energy system. It includes the improvement of the economic, exergetic, energetic, and environmental performance through the development of various optimization scenarios. This is done through the development of an extensive thermodynamic model and validation based upon energy, exergy, economic, and environmental evaluations. Different machine learning techniques are adapted for digital twinning of the six performance indicators as a function of nine design variables including operational, source, and economic variables. It is shown that the artificial neural network offers the best statistical fit as compared to the other machine learning techniques including RMSE: 0.1768, R2:0.9999, MSE:0.0312, and MAE:0.1107 for the total work output. Energy-efficient design has yielded a total work output of 1044.86 kW, with a first law efficiency of 0.3322. The economic design offers the lowest cost of electricity at only 34.004 $/hr. The sensitivity analysis has shown that the following parameters are the most sensitivity: turbine inlet temperature (18.19%) and pressure (18.23%), geothermal inlet temperature (16.34%) and pressure (18.00%), and the ammonia water concentration at the inlet of separator (15.96%). © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Renewable energies offer new solutions to an ever-increasing energy demand. Wind energy is one of the main sources of electricity production, which uses winds to be converted to electrical energy with lower cost and environment saving. The major failures of a wind turbine occur in the bearings of high-speed shafts. This paper proposes the use of optimized machine learning to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of bearing based on vibration data and features extraction. Significant features are extracted from filtered band-pass of the squared raw signal where the health indicators are automatically selected using relief technique. Optimized Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) by Partical Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to model the non linear degradation of the extracted indicators. The proposed approach is applied on experimental setup of wind turbine where the results show its effectiveness for RUL estimation. © IMechE 2020.

AB  - The large-scale proliferation of renewable energy sources (RES) equipped with the converter generation is attributed to the different system responses as compared to the conventional centralized generation and it leads to the dearth of inertia which is essentially required in an electric power system. Aiming at the solutions to improve dynamic frequency response, an innovative controller design is suggested to damp out the stepper variations of frequency and dipper frequency nadir. This work proposes a Virtual synchronous machine (VSM) based on a swarm metaheuristic technique called Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in alleviating the frequency disturbances in multimachine system. ACO tuned VSM offers flexible inertia depending upon the severity that emerged in the system by optimal adjustment of the emulated inertia. In this suggested VSM, the external loop continuously tracks the system disturbances, and accordingly it modifies the controlled output which is further passed to the internal loop. Now, this loop identifies and computes the exact active power required to supply during transients and its computationis assisted by ACO based correction factor which provides optimal inertia constant to improve the dynamic stability of the system. The performance evaluation and comparison has been done on Kundur’s 3-area multimachine system aggregated with 3 areas with 6 synchronous generators and developed in a MATLAB environment which reveals the satisfactory performance of this ACO tuned VSM scheme. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.

AB  - In recent years, due to the increasing number of renewable energy sources, which are characterised by the stochastic nature of the generated power, interest in energy storage has increased. Commercial installations use simple deterministic methods with low economic efficiency. Hence, there is a need for intelligent algorithms that combine technical and economic aspects. Methods based on computational intelligence (CI) could be a solution. The paper presents an algorithm for optimising power flow in microgrids by using computational intelligence methods. This approach ensures technical and economic efficiency by combining multiple aspects in a single objective function with minimal numerical complexity. It is scalable to any industrial or residential microgrid system. The method uses load and generation forecasts at any time horizon and resolution and the actual specifications of the energy storage systems, ensuring that technological constraints are maintained. The paper presents selected calculation results for a typical residential microgrid supplied with a photovoltaic system. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the outcomes provided by a deterministic management system. The computational intelligence method allows the objective function to be adjusted to find the optimal balance of economic and technical effects. Initially, the authors tested the invented algorithm for technical effects, minimising the power exchanged with the distribution system. The application of the algorithm resulted in financial losses, €12.78 for the deterministic algorithm and €8.68 for the algorithm using computational intelligence. Thus, in the next step, a control favouring economic goals was checked using the CI algorithm. The case where charging the storage system from the grid was disabled resulted in a financial benefit of €10.02, whereas when the storage system was allowed to charge from the grid, €437.69. Despite the financial benefits, the application of the algorithm resulted in up to 1560 discharge cycles. Thus, a new unconventional case was considered in which technical and economic objectives were combined, leading to an optimum benefit of €255.17 with 560 discharge cycles per year. Further research of the algorithm will focus on the development of a fitness function coupled to the power system model. © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - Kenya is experiencing a fast increase in grid-connected intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs) to meet its increased power demand, and at the same time be able to fulfill its Paris Agreement obligations of abating greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, Kenya has 102 MW of grid-tied solar power and 410 MW of grid-tied wind power. However, these sources are very intermittent with low predictability. Thus, after their installation and integration into the grid, they impose a new challenge for the secure, reliable, and economic operation of the system. To mitigate these and to ensure proper planning of the system operations, accurate and faster prediction of the generation output of the wind energy resources and optimal design and sizing of storage for the large-scale wind energy integration into the grid are of paramount importance. Artificial intelligence (AI) and metaheuristic techniques have proven to be efficient and robust in offering solutions to complex nonlinear prediction and optimization problems. Therefore, this study aims to utilize backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm to conduct hourly prediction of the generation output of Lake Turkana Wind Power Plant (LTWPP), a 310 MW plant connected to the Kenyan power grid, and optimally size its battery energy storage system (BESS) using genetic algorithm (GA) to guarantee its dispatchability. The historical weather data, namely wind speed, ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, and generation output from LTWPP, are employed in the training, testing, and validation of the neural network. LTWPP and BESS are modelled in MATLAB R2016a software. Thereafter, the developed BPNN and GA algorithms are applied to the modelled systems to predict the wind output and optimize the storage system, respectively. BESS optimization with neural prediction reduces the BESS capacity and investment costs by 59.82%, while the overall dispatchability of LTWPP is increased from 73.36% to 90.14%, hence enabling the farm to meet its allowable loss of power supply probability (LPSP) index of 0.1 while guaranteeing its dispatchability.  © 2022 Hampfrey Odero et al.

AB  - In this article, a dual-stage frequency control strategy is proposed to maintain the reliable operation of an islanded interconnected micro-grid system. The controller helps micro-grid in frequency stabilization and maintains the load demand balance during abnormal operating conditions. The multi-microgrid system comprises a biodiesel generation unit wind turbine, redox flow battery (RFB) in area-1 and BDG, organic Rankine cycle-based solar thermal power unit, and a capacitive energy storage system (CES) unit in area-2. The CES maintains the transient frequency deviation and RFB fulfills the long-term power demand during abnormal conditions. In this proposed work, a novel and efficient optimization technique entitled modified African Buffalo Optimization (MABO) has been implemented for optimal tuning of PIDF, PID-PDF, and PDF controllers. Further, the performance of MABO is compared with recently deployed optimization techniques i.e. Corrected Moth Search Optimization (CMSO) and African Buffalo Optimization (ABO). Eigen-values stability analysis and bode plot analysis are considered to validate the efficacy of the proposed controller design. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been executed to manifest the potential of the proposed strategy for a wide variation in micro-grid specifications, magnitude, and fluctuation of step/random power load disturbance. The various performance analyses validate the dominance of the proposed approach in damping frequency oscillations during severe disturbances and uncertain conditions. © 2023 THE AUTHORS

AB  - The general context of this proposal is represented by the energy-efficient smart home that integrates renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic panels. The objective of this article is to minimize the amount of energy consumed from the national energy grid by producer-consumers of energy from renewable sources, in their own smart homes. In order to fulfill this goal, it was necessary to estimate the amount of renewable energy produced on the day-ahead horizon and to schedule the operation of controllable consumers in a smart home. To predict the amount of energy produced, two approaches were used: the first was based on data, and used techniques specific to artificial intelligence, more specifically, multilayer perceptron and radial-basis-function neural networks, and the second was based on models. The accuracy of the short-term prediction horizon of the techniques used was evaluated with quantitative performance indicators so that the most appropriate one in relation to the goal of the article could be selected to be used in the test scenarios. The scheduling of consumer functioning was based on their classification in relation to their ability to be controlled, and on the selection from the peer-reviewed literature of an optimization algorithm which, by load shifting from a smart home, ensured the optimal fulfillment of the objective function. The selected load-shifting algorithm was then integrated into and tested on a real database.

AB  - Solar energy has gained attention in the past two decades, since it is an effective renewable energy source that causes no harm to the environment. Solar Irradiation Prediction (SIP) is essential to plan, schedule, and manage photovoltaic power plants and grid-based power generation systems. Numerous models have been proposed for SIP in the literature while such studies demand huge volumes of weather data about the target location for a lengthy period of time. In this scenario, commonly availableArtificial Intelligence (AI) technique can be trained over past values of irradiance as well as weatherrelated parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and precipitation. Therefore, in current study, the authors aimed at developing a solar irradiance prediction model by integrating big data analytics with AI models (BDAAI- SIP) using weather forecasting data. In order to perform long-term collection of weather data, Hadoop MapReduce tool is employed. The proposed solar irradiance prediction model operates on different stages. Primarily, data preprocessing take place using various sub processes such as data conversion, missing value replacement, and data normalization. Besides, Elman Neural Network (ENN), a type of feedforward neural network is also applied for predictive analysis. It is divided into input layer, hidden layer, loadbearing layer, and output layer. To overcome the insufficiency of ENN in choosing the value of weights and hidden layer neuron count, Mayfly Optimization (MFO) algorithm is applied. In order to validate the performance of the proposed model, a series of experiments was conducted. The experimental values infer that the proposed model outperformed other methods used for comparison. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Local electricity markets are a promising idea to foster the efficiency and use of renewable energy at the distribution level. However, as such a new concept, how these local markets will be designed and integrated into existing market structures, and make the most profit from them, is still unclear. In this work, we propose a local market mechanism in which end-users (consumers, small producers, and prosumers) trade energy between peers. Due to possible low liquidity in the local market, the mechanism assumes that end-users fulfill their energy demands through bilateral contracts with an aggregator/retailer with access to the wholesale market. The allowed bids and offers in the local market are bounded by a feed-in tariff and an aggregator tariff guaranteeing that end-users get, at most, the expected cost without considering this market. The problem is modeled as a multi-leader single-follower bi-level optimization problem, in which the upper levels define the maximization of agent profits. In contrast, the lower level maximizes the energy traded in the local market. Due to the complexity of the matter, and lack of perfect information of end-users, we advocate the use of evolutionary computation, a branch of artificial intelligence that has been successfully applied to a wide variety of optimization problems. Throughout three different case studies considering end-users with distinct characteristics, we evaluated the performance of four different algorithms and assessed the benefits that local markets can bring to market participants. Results show that the proposed market mechanism provides overall costs improvements to market players of around 30–40% regarding a baseline where no local market is considered. However, the shift to local markets in energy procurement can affect the conventional retailer/aggregator role. Therefore, innovative business models should be devised for the successful implementation of local markets in the future. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Autonomous off-grid systems dependent upon Renewable Energy (RE) sources are characterized by stochastic supplies of the fluctuating low short-circuit power. Power Quality (PQ) standards define load characteristics in electric power systems and their ability to function properly without failures. Monitoring, prediction and optimization of PQ parameters are necessary to maintain their alterations steady within the prescribed range, which allow fault-tolerant operation of various electrical devices. It is not possible to measure complete PQ data for all possible combinations of dozens of grid-connected appliances, whose load specifics and collisions primarily determine the course of PQ parameters and their eventual disturbances. Self-adapting PQ prediction models based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are required as induced power is influenced particularly by changeable weather conditions in real off-grid operation mode of systems using RE. A novel multi-step PQ prediction algorithm is proposed, which develops AI models with the gradually increasing number of selected input PQ-parameters. In each next step a more complex model is formed, using an additional co-related PQ-input to calculate its target PQ-output with a better accuracy. PQ-models with the progressively growing PQ-inputs, using their data predicted in the previous step, can better approximate and estimate the target quantity. The presented results show this training and feature selection procedure can step by step improve accuracy of PQ-models for unknown combinations of off-grid connected household appliances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewable energy sources are among the best substitute sources to fossil fuel due to it is very suitable for mitigating global warming; solar energy is considered the main causes of renewable energy, and solar photovoltaic (PV) generation systems have gained importance worldwide due to several characteristics, including cheap maintenance, low noise, and low fuel costs. However, one of the most difficult challenges facing solar energy systems is changing weather circumstances. The robust control approach stabilizes the PV system's output and maximizes harvested energy. In this study, several maximum power point tracking (MPPT) performances have been presented. Among them, artificial intelligence (AI) based on MPPT methods demonstrates the ability to capture the MPP point. There are several ways to apply AI to MPPT, and this paper presented various intelligent MPPT methods in detail with their benefits and drawbacks and comparison among them to select which technique is suitable and can be used to change weather conditions with horse optimization method (HOM) plus neural artificial system (NAS). © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - The liberalization of the retail market of electricity increased the tariff choice of end-use consumers. Retailers compete in the retail market for customers, obtaining private portfolios of end-use consumers to manage. Retailers buy electricity at wholesale markets to feed their customers’ demands. They can use spot, derivatives, and bilateral markets to acquire the energy they need. The increasing levels of variable renewable energy sources trading at spot markets, increase the price volatility of these markets. To hedge against the volatility of spot prices, retailers may negotiate standard physical or financial bilateral contracts at derivatives markets. Alternatively, they can also negotiate private bilateral contracts. This article addresses the optimization of the retailers purchasing options, to increase their risk-return ratio from electricity markets, and offer more competitive tariffs to consumers. Considering the risk attitude of retailers, they use a multi-step purchasing model composed of a multi-level risk-return optimization and a decision support system. The article presents an agent-based study considering a retailer with a portfolio of 312 real-world consumers. Risk-seeking and risk-neutral retailers obtained a return up to 38%, less than 7% of the optimal return. However, risk-neutral retailers are subject to four times higher risk in their returns than risk-seeking retailers. The results support the conclusion that wholesale markets of electricity are more favourable to risk-seeking retailers, considering their real returns. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The greater the demand for energy, the more important it is to improve and develop permanent energy sources, because of their advantages over non-renewable energy sources. With the development of artificial intelligence algorithms and the presence of so many data, the evolution of simulation models has increased. In this research, an improvement to one recent optimization algorithm called the artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA) is proposed. An adaptive opposition approach is suggested to select whether or not to use an opposition-based learning (OBL) method. This improvement is developed based on adding an adaptive updating mechanism to enable the original algorithm to obtain more accurate results with more complex problems, and is called the adaptive opposition artificial hummingbird algorithm (AOAHA). The proposed AOAHA was tested on 23 benchmark functions and compared with the original algorithm and other recent optimization algorithms such as supply–demand-based optimization (SDO), wild horse optimizer (WHO), and tunicate swarm algorithm (TSA). The proposed algorithm was applied to obtain accurate models for solar cell systems, which are the basis of solar power plants, in order to increase their efficiency, thus increasing the efficiency of the whole system. The experiments were carried out on two important models—the static and dynamic models—so that the proposed model would be more representative of real systems. Two applications for static models have been proposed: In the first application, the AOAHA satisfies the best root-mean-square values (0.0009825181). In the second application, the performance of the AOAHA is satisfied in all variable irradiance for the system. The results were evaluated in more than one way, taking into account the comparison with other modern and powerful optimization techniques. Improvement showed its potential through its satisfactory results in the tests that were applied to it. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Various techniques have been used in the optimization of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES). The most effective are metaheuristic algorithms based on artificial intelligence (AI) because of their ability to handle various parameters such as multiple objectives, parallelism features that allow for simultaneous evaluation of multiple schemes, and their ability to obtain optimal results that are systematic and deterministic. However, in the application of optimization algorithms regarding the Non-free lunch theorem, one algorithm performs better than the other in obtaining the best fitness function with convergence time. Therefore, the slime mould algorithm (SMA) prowess was tested in HRES optimization against two conflicting multi-objectives. The best fitness function for the total annual cost (TAC) was obtained with minimum convergence time, while the relationship between TAC and loss of load probability (LOLP) is shown to be proportionate to one another. The SMA provided optimal sizing of solar PV, hydro turbine, and biogas generator to meet the load requirement of the study area. In addition, the result shows that SMA is more promising in terms of convergence time. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®

AB  - The use of physics-based models for the development and optimization of energy systems is popular due to their versatility. However, their inherent complexity often makes these simulations computationally prohibitive, despite the current computational power available nowadays. This problem is aggravated when considering renewable energy systems, which are subjected to intermittent weather conditions and must be operated in connection with a grid of variable demand. In that sense, the use of metamodels has shown immense potential in the simulation, analysis, and optimization of energy systems. Therefore, this review presents a comprehensive analysis of the extensive application of metamodeling techniques in energy systems. After conducting a careful search using the Scopus database while targeting a well-defined group of keywords, 474 articles published from 2013 to 2023 were obtained in the present literature review. With a rigorous filtering and screening process, the first pool of articles was reduced to 126. The resulting articles were then separated in two main groups, reviews and research articles. Each of these groups was further organized in terms of the energy system studied, as well as the applicability, machine learning technique and error indicator. The results indicate a steady and significant growth in the number of publications associated with energy systems and different types of metamodeling techniques. The reasons are arguably twofold, reduction of computational time provided by the metamodels and their good accuracy. Nevertheless, and as reported by other studies, the review also identified the need to develop a standardized method for evaluating the error analysis of these models and a comparison between their actual efficiency, which includes accuracy and time. Furthermore, no clear relation was found between specific types of metamodels and specific energy systems. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Global water scarcity is an imminent problem caused by the increasing water demand arising from population and economic growth. Against this background, technologies for water resource management and treatment have been developed steadily to meet the water demand targets. However, further advances are necessary for securing environmental and economic sustainability. The management of saline water and wastewater is one of the focus areas to tackle the problems of water scarcity and sustainability in the context of water desalination. Hybrid desalination is one of the most practical and efficient technologies that can afford environmental and economic sustainability. Hybridization of multiple processes maximizes the advantages of individual technologies and minimizes their drawbacks. The overall research on desalination and research on hybrid desalination, in particular, increased by a compound annual growth rate of 16.6% and 21.8%, respectively, from 2011 to 2020. Meanwhile, in 2020, 10.7% of scientific articles and reviews dealt with hybrid technologies. Moreover, the advances in hybrid technology are not limited to academic research; they have been widely implemented in the desalination industry. Reverse osmosis–multistage flash (RO-MSF) hybrid technology has been adopted for the largest desalination plant in the world, with a total water production of 1,036,000 m3/d in Ras Al-Khair, Saudi Arabia. The synergetic impacts of hybridization have various benefits depending on the desalination processes selected. In an RO-MSF system, the hybridization leads to additional water production with higher water recovery compared to a standalone RO system. Improvement in energy efficiency is another advantage of hybrid technologies as observed in the case of membrane distillation–adsorp-tion (MD-AD) hybrid system. However, the challenges of hybrid desalination technologies are the complexity of process design, optimization, and operations. In this paper, the case of a forward osmosis–membrane distillation (FO-MD) hybrid system is presented to identify the challenges and potential solutions for hybrid desalination technologies. An FO process is driven by the osmotic pressure difference between two streams and produces water across a hydrophilic polymeric membrane. By using a saline solution, known as the draw solu-tion, freshwater may be recovered from a targeted feed solution stream with relatively lower salin-ity. MD is a thermal membrane process that makes use of the difference in vapor pressure between hot and cold streams to transport water vapor across the membrane to a cold permeate solution. These two membrane processes (FO and MD) are selected to treat the produced water, which is a by-product in the oil and gas industry; produced water has extremely high salinity and complex organic composition and hence is one of the most challenging wastewater streams for water treat-ment. Since FO and MD employ two different energy potentials (i.e., osmotic and thermal ener-gies, respectively), hybridization allows maximizing the use of available energy in target streams (i.e., produced water). To solve the challenge of complexity of hybridization, a novel integrated membrane module was developed for an FO-MD hybrid system. To evaluate the performance of the FO-MD hybrid system for produced water treatment, syn-thetic produced water streams were prepared according to water quality references from a conventional oil and gas production facility. Separate FO and MD experiments were conducted to study the membrane-fouling phenomena of different produced water qualities. In addition, the FO-MD hybrid system is operated with varied combinations of produced water streams for sustainability evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate the great potential of the FO-MD hybrid system for sustainable produced water treatment. Long-term operation of the hybrid system and experiments with real produced water samples are necessary for scaling up and optimizing the technology. Investigating the water–energy nexus related to the desalination technologies integrated with renewable energy is one approach to broaden the applications of hybrid desalination tech-nologies. Such a study will emphasize the advantages of hybridization despite the complex challenges. The benefits of hybrid technologies in terms of greater water production, higher recovery, and cleaner water quality will be synergized with less energy consumption by their integration with renewable energy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI)-based process design, optimization, and control will be an important tool to address the complexity of hybrid desalination technologies and will provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges, for which the conventional experimental and theoretical studies are still limited. AI algorithms, such as machine learning and artificial neural network algorithms, are the leading approaches to the advancement of AI-assisted smart desalination. © 2022 Desalination Publications.

AB  - One of the most challenging areas of Future Smart Cities Research is the Smart Energy domain. Critical issues related to optimization, provision of smart customizable networks and sophisticated computational techniques and methods enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning need further investigation. The renewable energy (RE) is a powerful resource for the future global development in the context of climate change and resources depletion. Artificial intelligence (AI) implies new rules of organizing the activities in order to respond to these new requirements. It is necessary to improve the design of the energy infrastructure, the deployment and production of RE in order to face the multiple challenges that will affect the sector's growth and resilience.. In this research work we exploit the recent developments on the AI adoption for RE sector in European Union (EU). In this respect, we analysed (i) the efficiency of the transformation processes of the RE within the energy chain from Gross Inland Consumption to Final Energy Consumption, (ii) its implications on the structure of renewable energy by source (solar, wind, biomass etc.), (iii) the labour productivity in RE sector compared to the economy as a whole and its correlation with investments level, (iv) the implication of the adoption of AI for RE towards Future Smart Cities Research. The main contribution of this research is the development of a framework for understanding the contribution of AI in the RE sector in Europe. Another bold contribution of this work is the discussion of the implications for Future Smart Cities Research and future research directions. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The development of autonomous energy systems has been accompanied by a number of challenges related to the specific characteristics of these systems, such as power flow control, development of protection systems respecting the dynamic changes in short-circuit power and the issue of compliance with power quality parameters. To keep the power quality parameters of electrical energy in Off-Grid systems within the limit is highly complicated with regards to the supply of electrical energy from renewable sources of a stochastic nature, which are used as dominant sources of electric or heat energy. Variations in short-circuit power may significantly affect the system stability and may have a negative impact on the operation in case of sensitive appliances. We developed tools and methods to keep the power quality parameters in Off-Grid systems within the limits using an intelligent approach based on an artificial intelligence technique. Our computational model is able to predict disturbances in power quality and perform a set of proper reactions to avoid such disturbances with over 60% success rate in time horizon of 15 min ahead. As a result, it is subsequently possible to optimize the operation of Off-Grid systems and thus contribute to improvements in the power quality parameters in Off-Grid systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the context of the increasingly serious environmental pollution and the gradual depletion of fossil energy, the development of energy systems tends to be cleaner and smarter. Our country has promoted the development of smart energy to a national strategy. As a core part of energy system, power system has wide application and strong regulation ability and its control is complex, and its intelligence level will determine the intelligence level of the energy system. With the high proportion of new energy terminals such as distributed power, electric vehicles and distributed energy storage components which have diversified features including energy production, storage and consumption in power grids, modern power systems are characterized by complex nonlinearity, strong uncertainty and strong coupling. The traditional modeling, optimization and control technologies have many limitations. Artificial intelligence technology will be effective in solving complex system control and decision problems, therefore, this article combs the development of artificial intelligence in the application of power system firstly. According to the hot area of application of artificial intelligence in power system, this paper expounds the application of artificial intelligence in power system scheduling, planning and electricity market and the future direction of the research content is prospected. © 2018, Editorial Office of Control and Decision.

AB  - In this paper, we comparatively evaluate the performance of home energy management controller which is designed on the basis of heuristic algorithms; genetic algorithm (GA), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO). In this regard, we introduce a generic architecture for demand side management (DSM) which integrates residential area domain with smart area domain via wide area network. In addition, problem formulation is carried via multiple knapsack problem. For energy pricing, combined model of time of use tariff and inclined block rates is used. Simulation results show that all designed models for energy management act significantly to achieve our objections and proven as a cost-effective solution to increase sustainability of smart grid. GA based energy management controller performs more efficiently than BPSO based energy management controller and ACO based energy management controller in terms of electricity bill reduction, peak to average ratio minimization and user comfort level maximization. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research paper aims to develop a hybrid neuro-evolutionary wrapper-based model for daily global solar radiation estimation in the solar-rich Sunshine State of Queensland, Australia. To design a robust hybrid modelling mechanism, the Interim-ERA European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data are employed to train and cross-validate the estimation model that is formulated by an evolutionary-type algorithm: the Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) integrated with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model. The hybrid CRO-(ELM) algorithm is applied in two stages: first for the feature selection process guided by an ELM algorithm (a class of fast training neural network tool) as the model's fitness function to screen an optimal set of predictor variables and second, for the estimation of the solar radiation using the optimally screened variables by the final hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system. To benchmark the performance of the hybrid CRO-ELM algorithm for this estimation problem we apply an alternative, yet a similar feature screening approach: the Grouping Genetic Algorithm encoded into the ELM-based model (GGA-(ELM) used as the predictor mechanism). After the feature selection process is performed by the CRO algorithm that extracts the data patterns for accurate estimation the alternative objective algorithm is applied (in this case the ELM again) to formulate the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM modelling system. To provide a rigorous evaluation of the CRO-(ELM)-ELM hybrid system, alternative estimation approaches are considered: the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). The hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system is tested in a real problem where the results are evaluated by means of several statistical score metrics and diagnostic plots of the observed and the estimated daily global solar radiation in the testing phase. We show that the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM model is able to yield promising results; thus improving those attained by the 7 alternative models (i.e., hybrid CRO-(ELM)-MARS, CRO-(ELM)-MLR and CRO-(ELM)-SVR and the GGA equivalent models). The study ascertains that the CRO-based hybrid system where a large pool of predictor data are carefully screened through a wrapper-based modelling system and the ELM model is applied as a objective estimation tool can be adopted as a qualified stratagem in solar radiation estimation problems. The proposed hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system exhibits clear advantages over the alternative machine learning approaches tested and also over the other machine learning algorithms used without the feature selection tool; thus advocating its scientific utility in renewable energy applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Investment decisions in renewable energy sources such as small hydro, wind power, biomass and solar are frequently made in the context of enormous uncertainty surrounding both intermittent generation and the highly volatile electricity spot prices that are used for clearing of trades. This paper presents a new portfolio-based approach for selecting long-term investments in small-scale renewable energy projects and matching contracts for the sale of the resulting electricity. Using this approach, we have formulated a stochastic optimisation model that maximises a holding company's risk-averse measure of value. Using an illustrative example representative of investment decisions within the Brazilian electricity system, we investigate the sensitivity of the optimised portfolio composition and commercialisation strategy to contract prices in the free contracting environment and to the decision maker's attitude towards risk. The numerical results demonstrate it is possible to reduce significantly financial risks, such as the price-quantity risk, not only by exploiting the complementarity of the considered renewable sources generation profiles, but also by selecting the optimal mix of commercialisation contracts from different markets. We find that the multi-market strategy generally results in appreciably higher optimal value than single-market strategies and can be applied to a wide range of renewable generators and contracts. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To alleviate the overloads in the power system and to reduce the exponential growth in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, deployment of the renewable energy sources (RES) into the power system is the need of the hour. However, injecting these RES into the current power system network causes large voltage and power overshoots hence deteriorate the transient response and power quality of the overall power system. In this paper, an efficient solution of the above-mentioned issues is explored by developing an optimal microgrid (MG) controller using one of the most modern and intelligent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques named the salp swarm optimization algorithm (SSA). The intelligence of the SSA is exploited to select the optimal controller gains and dc-link capacitance value by minimizing a time integrating error fitness function (FF) which in-turn enhances the dynamic response and power quality of the studied MG system. The proposed grid-tied MG controller is designed to achieve the preset active and reactive power sharing ratio between distributed generator (DG) and utility grid during DG and load switching conditions. To validate the superiority of the proposed controller, its performance is compared with that of its precedent grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA)-based controller for the identical operating conditions and system configuration. The outcomes of the study show that the proposed MG controller outperforms its competitor in terms of transient response and quality of power. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In power production the renewable energy resources especially wind systems gains much attention in the recent past years. Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) is one of the ultimate governing grid connection prerequisites to be met by Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS). Low voltage ride through prerequisite demands management of the mismatch in voltage due to uncertain conditions, which is a challenge for the WECS. Moreover the voltage dips or voltage sag is the utmost prominent power quality issue in power system. In order to maintain the power quality in power system while the usage of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) in WECS, a controller circuit can be used. Here the controlling of PMSG is given by the controllers ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) and CANFIS (Coactive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System) both are tuned by the hybrid artificial intelligence techniques particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. Both controller techniques are used for the LVRT improvement and the performance of the controllers are compared. From the comparison the CANFIS tuned by GAPSO performance is proved to be the best one for the power quality improvement in wind energy conversion system. © (Publication Year), (publisher Name).

AB  - Integrating renewable energy into power grids is seen in increase in recent years since these energy sources are sustainable and clean. However, the integration brings about considerable technical challenges associated with fluctuations and uncertainties of the energy availability whilst maintaining the stability of smart grids. The prediction of renewable energy generation is key to achieve optimal power dispatch in renewable-intensive smart grids. However, uncertain interruption and prediction errors will make an optimal decision more challenging. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective way to overcome the discrepancies between the prediction and the real-world system through a closed-loop correction over iteration process. This study develops an improved MPC scheme used with a hybrid energy storage system for optimal power dispatch in a smart grid. This hybrid renewable energy system consists of a wind farm, a hydrogen/oxygen storage system and several fuel cells (FCs). In this study, particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a back propagation (BP) artificial neural network is developed to predict the wind energy availability by using measured data. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is combined with a state space model (SSM) to achieve the MPC control. A dataset of 24-hour ahead predictive generation is calibrated from the measured data and is defined for optimal power flow between the grid, the wind farm and the storage subsystem so as to balance the supply and load. The optimization target is to achieve a minimal energy exchange between the power grid and the hybrid renewable energy storage system. Based on actual measured data, the test results have shown that the proposed methodology can maximize the local usage of wind power whilst minimizing the power exchange with the grid. An optimal power dispatch strategy is proved to be effective to meet the demand and efficiency with dynamic control of the FCs. The usage of the intermittent wind power is increased from 45% to 90% in the four test studies. Therefore, this work can minimize the impact of fluctuating renewable energy on the power grid and enhance uptakes of FC-based energy systems. This is particularly economic and relevant to the remote and under-developed regions where their power networks are weak and vulnerable. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The value of energy storage systems can be maximized if they store energy when the usable generation capacity is sufficient and release it if the capacity becomes small. The energy market can provide the clear price signals showing the shortage degree of generation capacity. A sensitivity analysis on the market price regarding to the output of storage systems can help consider the effect of storage systems on the market, which however turns the optimization problem into a nonlinear type. A novel optimization framework is created using the latest achievement in the artificial intelligence research area and a series of value networks, in order to solve the dynamic decision problem. A value network is used to estimate the decision value on each feasible state distributed in a 2D limited-resolution state space of time and storage status. The continuous increase of resolution will lead to an approximation of quasi-optimal dispatch solution. Based on the method, the adequacy analysis for a power system consisted of energy storage and diversified types of generation is done, in order to not only verify the effectiveness of the method, but also demonstrate the simulated results on how the dispatching center reaches a win-win goal for users, storage and generation, by using energy storage systems to smooth price peaks and decrease wind or solar power curtailment loss. © 2016 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.

AB  - To efficiently manage unstable wind power generation, precise short-term wind speed forecasting is critical. To overcome the challenges in wind speed forecasting, this paper proposes a new convolutional neural network algorithm for short-term forecasting. In this paper, the forecasting performance of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of four other artificial intelligence algorithms commonly used in wind speed forecasting. Numerical testing results based on data from a designated wind site in Taiwan were used to demonstrate the efficiency of above-mentioned proposed learning method. Mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were adopted as accuracy evaluation indexes in this paper. Experimental results indicate that the MAE and RMSE values of the proposed algorithm are 0.800227 and 0.999978, respectively, demonstrating very high forecasting accuracy. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents reformed electric system cascade analysis (RESCA) technique for optimization of hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) comprising of wind energy conversion system (WECS), photovoltaic (PV) system, battery energy storage system, and nonintermittent source (NIS). Optimization constraints of final excess energy, energy generation ratio, cost of energy, net present cost (NPC), and renewable energy fraction are considered for the optimization of the system. This optimization is realized for an isolated load comprising of the ten households in Malaysia with a daily consumption of 84.5 kWh. On successful implementation of RESCA with different constraints, it is found that the optimum size of energy sources for the HRES varies depending on the chosen constraints. Also, the NPC of the system can be considerably reduced on introduction of NIS to the HRES. RESCA provides the user with better insight into the influence of variation of PV and WECS power generation while identifying the optimal size of energy storage unit. The optimized results obtained are also compared with benchmark HOMER software to validate the methodology. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Currently, there is a remarkable focus on green technologies for taking steps towards more use of renewable energy sources within the sector of transportation and also decreasing pollution. At this point, employment of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) needs sufficient charging allocation strategy, by running smart charging infrastructures and smart grid systems. In order to daily usage of PHEVs, daytime charging stations are required and at this point, only an appropriate charging control and a management of the infrastructure can lead to wider employment of PHEVs. In this study, four swarm intelligence based optimization techniques: particle swarm optimization (PSO), gravitational search algorithm (GSA), accelerated particle swarm optimization, and hybrid version of PSO and GSA (PSOGSA) have been applied for the state-of-charge optimization of PHEVs. In this research, hybrid PSOGSA has performed very well in producing better results than other stand-alone optimization techniques. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Reactive power plays a vital role in the real power transfer by maintaining voltage stability and system reliability. Wind farms (WFs) have been promoted as a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional, non-renewable energy production. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm comprising an Iterative Optimal Power Flow Estimation (IOPFE) with a novel Load Tracing based on Artificial intelligence techniques like Meta heuristic Search Algorithm (LT-MSA) is proposed to optimally estimate the cost of reactive power in wind farms. To achieve this target, tracing and sensitivity methods can be employed whereas the latter is found to be superior. The convergence graphs for load tracing using the proposed algorithm are plotted to prove faster convergence and reduced error rate when compared to other algorithms namely Blended Crossover-Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (BX-CACO), Continuous domain Ant Colony Optimization (ACOR), Evolutionary Programming (EP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Later on, a comparison chart for active power pricing on all the 15 generators in practical 75-bus Indian system Wind Farms (WFs) is plotted to compare our proposed algorithm with other tracing algorithms like Bialek's and Kirschen's tracing and to prove the solution optimality. Further, this proposed hybrid algorithm is utilized for the estimation of cost of reactive power in practical 75-bus Indian system WFs in an optimal manner.

AB  - Purpose-Renewable generation is a main component of most hybrid generation systems. However, randomness on its generation is a characteristic to be considered due to its direct impact on reliability and performance of these systems. For this reason, renewable generation usually is accompanied with other generation elements to improve their general performance. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the power generation system, composed of solar, wind and diesel generation and power outsourcing option from the grid as means of reserve source. A multi-objective optimization for the design of hybrid generation system is proposed, particularly using the cost of energy, two different reliability indexes and the percentage of renewable energy as objectives. Further, the uncertainty of renewable sources and demand is modeled with a new technique that permits to evaluate the reliability quickly. Design/methodology/approach-The multi-state model of the generators and the load is modeled with the Universal Generating Function (UGF) to estimate the reliability indexes for the whole system. Then an evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) is used to solve the multi-objective optimization model. Findings-The use of UGF methodology reduces the computation time, providing effective results. The validation of reliability assessment of hybrid generation systems using the UGF is carried out taking as a benchmark the results obtained with the Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed multiobjective algorithm gives as a result different generators combinations that outline hybrid systems, where some of them could be preferred over others depending on its results for each independent objective. Also it allows us to observe the changes produced on the resulting solutions due to the impact of the power fluctuation of the renewable generators. Originality/value-The main contributions of this paper are: an extended multi state model that includes different types of renewable energies, with emphasis on modeling of solar energy; demonstrate the performance improvement of UGF against SMC regarding the computational time required for this case; test the impact of different multi-states numbers for the representation of the elements; depict through multi-objective optimization, the impact of combining different energies on the cost and reliability of the resultant systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The increase in energy demand and soaring prices of fossil fuels together with concerns about environmental issues have generated enormous interest in the utilization of renewable energy sources. In recent years, the solar energy is drawing more attention owing to its advantages such as zero green houses emission & pollution, low maintenance cost, absence of moving parts and freedom from environmental pollution. Due to the high initial cost of Photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems and their low energy conversion efficiency, a PV system is generally operated to extract maximum power from the PV source. The objective of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is to extract maximum power generated by the PV systems under varying conditions of temperature and solar insolation. A major challenge in PV systems is to analyze the nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics so as to obtain a unique maximum power point on its power-voltage (P-V) characteristic curve. The process of MPPT is complicated due to the fact that the PV curves vary largely with solar insolation and temperature. Many researchers have proposed and implemented a variety of methods, both conventional and non-conventional, to solve MPPT problem. However, most of conventional tracking methods fail to work properly under partial shaded conditions. Partial shaded SPV modules produce several local maximum power points, making the tracking of Global Maximum Power Point (GMPP) difficult. Hence many researchers have tried to use artificial intelligence techniques such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution (DE), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Colony of Fire Flies (FF), Cuckoo Search (CS), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Symbiotic Organism Search (SOS) algorithm and Fruitfly Optimization Algorithm (FOA) etc. This paper presents a review of artificial intelligence optimization techniques to address the Maximum Power Point Tracking of Solar Photovoltaic arrays under partial shaded conditions. The performances of these techniques are presented in respect of their tracking efficiency.

AB  - Wind energy is one of the supremely renewable energy sources and has been widely established worldwide. Due to strong seasonal variations in the wind resource, accurate predictions of wind resource assessment and appropriate wind speed distribution models (for any location) are the significant facets for planning and commissioning wind farms. In this work, the wind characteristics and wind potential assessment of onshore, o_shore, and nearshore locations of India-particularly Kayathar in Tamilnadu, the Gulf of Khambhat, and Jafrabad in Gujarat-are statistically analyzed with wind distribution methods. Further, the resource assessments are carried out using Weibull, Rayleigh, gamma, Nakagami, generalized extreme value (GEV), lognormal, inverse Gaussian, Rician, Birnbaum-Sandras, and Bimodal-Weibull distribution methods. Additionally, the advent of artificial intelligence and soft computing techniques with the moth flame optimization (MFO) method leads to superior results in solving complex problems and parameter estimations. The data analytics are carried out in the MATLAB platform, with in-house coding developed for MFO parameters estimated through optimization and other wind distribution parameters using the maximum likelihood method. The observed outcomes show that the MFO method performed well on parameter estimation. Correspondingly, wind power generation was shown to peak at the SouthWest Monsoon periods from June to September, with mean wind speeds ranging from 9 to 12 m/s. Furthermore, the wind speed distribution method of mixed Weibull, Nakagami, and Rician methods performed well in calculating potential assessments for the targeted locations. Likewise, the Gulf of Khambhat (offshore) area has steady wind speeds ranging from 7 to 10 m/s with less turbulence intensity and the highest wind power density of 431 watts/m2. The proposed optimization method proves its potential for accurate assessment of Indian wind conditions in selected locations.  © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Low-carbon economy is an emerging and inevitable pathway toward sustainable development of cold chain logistics. Low-temperature transportation is the crucial link of cold chain logistics to low-carbon economy and the industry is known to have the higher energy consumption. Prior studies are lacking in involving the carbon emission cost in the optimization process. Route optimization of low-temperature transportation is conducive to the low-carbon cold chain logistics. This study aims to introduce the low-carbon economy into the cold chain logistics. There are various costs needed to be considered in cold chain logistics, and a cold chain logistics route optimization model included the carbon emission cost was developed. Ribonucleic acid computing was combined with ant colony optimization to prevent the influence of unreasonable parameter selection on algorithm performance. This novel proposed approach was applied to solve the route optimization problem of a cold chain logistics firm located in the Xiong'an, China. The results showed this method reduced the overall cost of logistics and minimized the amount of carbon emissions. The finding shed the light on the low-carbon transformational development of cold chain logistics firms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, enormous progress has been made on power generation using photovoltaic (PV) system. Solar power is one of the most promising renewable energy sources that is providing its benefit specifically in rural areas. With the increasing need for solar energy, it becomes necessary to extract maximum power from the PV array. The output power of the solar cells varies directly with the ambient temperature and Irradiation. Therefore, the challenge is to track maximum power from the PV array when environmental factors change. This paper focuses on increasing the efficiency of a PV array by incorporating artificial intelligence techniques. The genetic algorithm-based optimization technique is developed in order to track maximum power at given ambient conditions. The performance of the algorithm was tested under various environmental conditions using MATLAB/Simulink. A comparative study is done on the PV system using the conventional perturb & observe algorithm and genetic algorithm. The results show that the proposed MPPT technique is capable of tracking maximum power from the PV array with reduced oscillation and fast tracking speed. © TÜBİTAK

AB  - A distributed power system with renewable energy sources is very popular in recent years due to the rapid depletion of conventional sources of energy. Reasonable sizing for such power systems could improve the power supply reliability and reduce the annual system cost. The goal of this work is to optimize the size of a stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic (PV)/wind turbine (WT)/battery (B)/hydrogen system (a hybrid system based on battery and hydrogen (HS-BH)) for reliable and economic supply. Two objectives that take the minimum annual system cost and maximum system reliability described as the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) have been addressed for sizing HS-BH from a more comprehensive perspective, considering the basic demand of load, the profit from hydrogen, which is produced by HS-BH, and an effective energy storage strategy. An improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm has been presented to solve the sizing problem of HS-BH. Finally, a simulation experiment has been done to demonstrate the developed results, in which some comparisons have been done to emphasize the advantage of HS-BH with the aid of data from an island of Zhejiang, China. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.

AB  - A new predictive approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and wellbore numerical simulation for the determination of pressure drops in flowing geothermal wells was successfully carried out. Several ANN computational models based on the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm, and the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid and linear transfer functions were evaluated. Two ANN models (ANN1 and ANN2, characterized by using five and six input variables, respectively; and a common structure of 9 neurons in the hidden layer) were found to be the most suitable architectures for a reliable determination of geothermal pressure gradients. These ANN models used a limited number of input variables which are commonly available in field measurements (e.g., wellbore production data: pressure, temperature and mass flow rate; and wellbore geometry data). Such ANN models were effectively trained by using a wellbore production database which was compiled from several world geothermal fi elds. Additional wellbore simulation works were also carried out by using the same production data and a numerical simulator (GEOWELLLS). The pressure gradients predicted by using all these computing tools (ANNs and GEOWELLS) were statistically compared with measured field data. From this matching analysis, it was demonstrated that the ANN2 model provided the most acceptable results (with average prediction errors less than 2.3%) in comparison with those results inferred from ANN1 and GEOWELL tools. Details of the computational methodology developed in this study, as well as the numerical validation, and the comparative statistical analysis are comprehensively described. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In many urbanized areas the roadside and nature conservation management offers a biomass-for-bioenergy resource potential which is barely valorized, because of the fragmented biomass production sites and the scarcity of accurate data on the spatial availability of the biomass. In this study, a GIS based assessment was performed to determine the regional non-woody biomass-for-bioenergy potential for biogas from conservation areas and roadsides in Flanders, Belgium. These systems, with an area of 31,055. ha, have an annual herbaceous biomass production of 203. kton dry matter. The full associated biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain was optimized in four scenarios to maximize the net energy output and the profit. The scenario analysis was performed with OPTIMASS, a recently developed GIS based strategic decision support system. The analysis showed that the energetic valorization of conservation and roadside biomass through anaerobic digestion had a positive net energy balance, although there is still much room for improvements. Economically, however, it is a less interesting biomass resource. Most likely, the economic picture would change when other ecosystem services delivered by the protected biodiversity would be taken into account. Future technical advances and governmental incentives, like green energy certificates, will be necessary to incorporate the biomass into the energy chain. By tackling the existing barriers and providing a detailed methodology for biomass potential assessments, this study tries to facilitate the valorization of conservation and roadside biomass in order to reconcile biodiversity and road safety goals with renewable energy targets. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This chapter proposes a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII) for the multi-objective optimal operation management (MOOM) for distributed microgrid. The main objective of the MOOM is to maximize the safe instantaneous system load, and minimizing the pollutant emission produced by the generating sources. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA) and NSGAII artificial intelligence techniques are studied and optimized for microgrid. The NSGAII control algorithm projected to maintain the grid voltage and angle stability within the IEEE standards while increased penetration. To construct the microgrid structure, the renewable energy sources such as wind energy, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and solar photo-voltaic (SPV) are considered. The robust NSGAII based optimization algorithm continuously monitors the grid conditions and regulates grid parameters for maximizing the instantaneous safe bus loading. Power system stability indices such as fast voltage stability indices (FVSI), line stability indices (LSI) and line stability factor (LQP). © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - In the context of renewable energies, precise and reliable forecasts are necessary to ensure a sustainable and economic operation of energy systems. This paper presents a methodology and environment that allows modelling, simulation and analysis of decentralized and heterogeneous energy system scenarios on a virtual level. An essential requirement for the modelling and simulation of complex network scenarios is a capable abstraction strategy, which allows hierarchical clustering and interaction of several network levels. The approach presented in this contribution provides mechanisms that allow a realistic modelling of complex energy system scenarios covering several network levels, taking into account the specific components, interactions and relationships that exist at each level (e.g. specific electrical lines etc.). The simulation follows a hierarchical tree-based approach, which allows to integrate already existing simulation models into the environment and to generate only a small overhead over the simulation run time. As we can show, the developed environment not only serves as an excellent basis for analysis and optimization purposes but also for the application of artificial intelligence techniques, as it supports the effective generation of training data and verification of optimization results. © 2019, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

AB  - Recent researches towards the use of green technologies to reduce pollution and higher penetration of renewable energy sources in the transportation sector have been gaining popularity. In this wake, extensive participation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) requires adequate charging allocation strategy using a combination of smart grid systems and smart charging infrastructures. Daytime charging stations will be needed for daily usage of PHEVs due to the limited all-electric range. Intelligent energy management is an important issue which has already drawn much attention of researchers. Most of these works require formulation of mathematical models with extensive use of computational intelligence-based optimization techniques to solve many technical problems. In this paper, gravitational search algorithm (GSA) has been applied and compared with another member of swarm family, particle swarm optimization (PSO), considering constraints such as energy price, remaining battery capacity, and remaining charging time. Simulation results obtained for maximizing the highly nonlinear objective function evaluate the performance of both techniques in terms of best fitness. © 2015 Imran Rahman et al.

AB  - Of the many kinds of renewable energy, wind power is low in cost and non-polluting, so it is especially well-suited to Taiwan. The Mai Liao Wind Farm is the most important wind farm in Taiwan, and forecasting the wind power output for national sustainable development continues to be a challenging research feature. In this study, we attempt to forecast the wind power data collected from the Mai Liao Wind Farm. Our forecast model is based on a Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP) model using the data collected at the Mai Liao Wind Farm over a period of five years from September 2002 to August 2007. We proposed a new algorithm, namely improved Simplified Swarm Optimization (iSSO), which improves Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO) by justifying the weights and bias in training the MLP. The proposed iSSO combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autocorrelation Function (AF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PAF) for the selection of features which increases the efficiency of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of iSSO outperforms the other six most popular algorithms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Strategic decision making at the building level is gaining importance in the context of a more and more deregulated energy market. The increase of the set of available options regarding distributed and renewable energy technologies leads to a complex decision process. Importantly, such decision making process is affected by uncertainties and therefore stochastic models are needed. In this paper, a comprehensive deterministic strategic optimization model for energy systems planning at the building level is extended to a stochastic optimization framework, thereby allowing the decision maker to manage risks in addition to considering the variability of the uncertain parameters. A numerical example shows the importance of taking into account uncertainty and risk in this kind of problems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Malaysia has abundant potentials of renewable energy resources mainly because of its rich agriculture that makes high potential in bio-power and its tropical climate, which provides sufficient sunlight for utilization of solar systems. Feed in Tariff mechanism has been applied since 2011 in Malaysia to expand utilization of renewable energy for electricity generation. In this study, a broad range of data is gathered to develop a comprehensive system dynamics model to evaluate the impacts of Feed in Tariff mechanism on the generation mix of Malaysia during a 20-year period between 2011 and 2030. Results demonstrate that although the policy may lead to a satisfactory level of target achievement but the Malaysian government may face an increasing shortage in its RE fund budget starting around 2019 unless it increases its income sources by rising the surcharges on electricity bills or decreases its expenditures by optimizing the amount of FiT payments in different periods. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that the more funding will not lead to a more sustainable generation mix unless it is paid in the right time and in the right direction. Using this model, policymakers can carry out analysis to determine the amount of money that must be collected from the electricity consumers through the surcharges on electricity bills as well as the amount of feed in tariff to be paid for different renewable resources in different periods. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the automatic load frequency control (ALFC) of two-area multisource hybrid power system (HPS). The interconnected HPS model consists of conventional and renewable energy sources operating in disparate combinations to balance the generation and load demand of the system. In the proffered work, the stability analysis of nonlinear dynamic HPS model was analyzed using the Hankel method of model order reduction. Also, an attempt was made to apply cascade proportional integral-proportional derivative (PI-PD) control for HPS. The gains of the controller were optimized by minimizing the integral absolute error (IAE) of area control error using particle swarm optimization-gravitational search algorithm (PSO-GSA) optimization technique. The performance of cascade control was compared with other classical controllers and the efficiency of this approach was studied for various cases of HPS model. The result shows that the cascade control produced better transient and steady state performances than those of the other classical controllers. The robustness analysis also reveals that the system overshoots/undershoots in frequency response pertaining to random change in wind power generation and load perturbations were significantly reduced by the proposed cascade control. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of the system was performed, with the variation in step load perturbation (SLP) of 1% to 5%, system loading and inertia of the system by ±25% of nominal values to prove the efficiency of the controller. Furthermore, to prove the efficiency of PSO-GSA tuned cascade control, the results were compared with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods presented in the literature. Further, the stability of the system was analyzed in frequency domain for different operating cases. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Scientists and researchers are exploring different methods of generating and delivering electrical energy in an economical and reliable way, enabling them to generate electricity focusing on renewable energy resources. All of these possess the natural property of self-changing behavior, so the connection of these separate independent controllable units to the grid leads to uncertainties. This creates an imbalance in active power and reactive power. In order to control the active and reactive power in wind turbine generators with adjustable speed, various control strategies are used to allay voltage and current variations. This research work is focused on the design and implementation of effective control strategies for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) to control its active and reactive power. A DFIG system with its control strategies is simulated on MATLAB software. To augment the transient stability of DFIG, the simulation results for the active and reactive power of conventional controllers are compared with three types of feed forward neural network controllers, i.e., probabilistic feedforward neural network (PFFNN), multi-layer perceptron feedforward neural network (MLPFFN) and radial basic function feedforward neural network (RBFFN) for optimum performance. Conclusive outcomes clearly manifest the superior robustness of the RBFNN controller over other controllers in terms of rise time, settling time and overshoot value. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Renewable energies, specifically solar energy has been employed in numerous applications while being CO2 emission free energy in comparison with fossil fuel resources. The main purpose of this study is to predict thermal efficiency of photovoltaic-thermal (PV/T) setups in regard with input temperature, recirculation flow rate, and solar irradiation by modifying multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP-ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) approaches. For this goal, more than 100 empirical measurements were performed on a fabricated water-cooled PV/T setup. Several numerical analyses are also carried out to assess the validity of the presented models. It is confirmed that there is a great agreement between predictive models and actual data. The proposed ANN model provided the best performance due to the mean squared error (MSE) and determination coefficient (R2) values of 0.009 and 1.00, respectively. Also, numerical comparisons with other recently developed models were performed. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - The artificial intelligence technology has outstanding advantages in solving complex problems efficiently. Energy Internet, fusing energy with information technology, can provide consumers with flexible energy shaing services. Due to the intermittence and volatility of power generation by renewable energy, not only effective utilization of renewable energy requires more real-time information of energy supply and demand, but also the mode of energy supply and demand becomes more complex and vaiable. Recently, arificial intelligence technology has been widely used in system modeling, prediction, control, optimization, and other aspects in the field of energy Internet. This paper makes an overview on the current reseach outputs of the arificial intelligence technology in typical application scenaios in energy Internet.

AB  - European energy policies drive to energy efficiency and renewable energies. This global view, converted into national regulations, finds difficulties with energy market, technology costs, and mutable economic conditions making difficult the evaluation of the profitability of these projects. Based upon the above considerations, a Decision Support System for the evaluation of the sustainability of Biomass Combined Heat and Power (BCHP) Plants is here presented. The model provides a technical-economic quantification of a CHP Plant supplied by biomass, with Rankine thermal cycle and District Heating (DH) network serving an industrial district. The aim of the model is to find the optimal Plant configuration in terms of steam turbine choice and the consequent thermal cycle parameters by varying decisional variables describing the type of industrial district, its yearly thermal loads (heating and cooling), the requested carrier fluid, the pipeline distances from the Power Plant. Other parameters, as the feed-in-premium tariff for the electrical energy and natural gas integration, have been considered. Starting by variable and fixed costs and revenues, the Internal Rate of Return of the project has been calculated. An optimal Plant configuration has been defined, and a sensitivity analysis have been performed. The model has been applied to a case related to the city of Quattordio in northern Italy.

AB  - Increased use of renewable energies in smart microgrids (SMGs) present new technical challenges to system operation. SMGs must be self-sufficient and operate independently; however, when more elements are integrated into SMGs, as distributed energy resources (DER), traditional explicit mathematical formulations will demand too much data from the network and become intractable. In contrast, tools based on optimization with metaheuristics can provide near optimal solutions in acceptable times. Considering this, this paper presents the variable neighborhood search differential evolutionary particle swarm optimization (VNS-DEEPSO) algorithm to solve multi-objective stochastic control models, as SMGs system operation. The goal is to control DER while maximizing profit. In this work, DER considered the bidirectional communication between energy storage systems (ESS) and electric vehicles (EVs). They can charge/discharge power and buy/sell energy in the electricity markets. Also, they have elements such as traditional generators (e.g., reciprocating engines) and loads, with demand response/control capability. Sources of uncertainty are associated with weather conditions, planned EV trips, load forecasting and the market prices. The VNS-DEEPSO algorithm was the winner of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation/The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (IEEE-CEC/GECCO 2019) smart grid competition (with encrypted code) and also won the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (IEEE-WCCI) 2018 smart grid competition (these competitions were developed by the group GECAD, based at the Polytechnic Institute of Porto, in collaboration with Delft University and Adelaide University). In the IEEE-CEC/GECCO 2019, the relative error improved between 32% and 152% in comparison with other algorithms. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Pre-packaged cogeneration systems are popular as lead supply in distributed and isolated energy systems aimed at empowering remote off-grid communities and in supporting eco-villages in nature reserves. Energy cooperatives and independent power producers deploy cogeneration systems in community shared microgrid configurations as building blocks in smart localised multi-carrier energy grids. Small-scale renewable energy and distributed energy resources in the energy mix of multi-carrier combined heat and power microgrids call for the development of intelligent control automation solutions. This paper describes a multi-objective optimization solution where hierarchical digital microgrid control is integrated into solar powered micro-cogeneration. The control solution includes an integrated cost-competitive economic and environmental optimization algorithm customized around the needs of small off-grid isolated village settlements. A secondary stage optimization loop functions as a storage capacity decision support system, to alert the community when operating costs can be reduced through an investment into increased storage capacity for the village microgrid. This cost-aware control optimization algorithm is tested in a rural village microgrid by using parametric computer simulation models of a hybrid residential solar cogeneration system. Digital simulation experiments evaluate the operational plans and operational cost performances of energy management for different storage scenarios at an isolated remote rural location in Africa. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To maximize the environmental performance of the energy systems, a paradigm change towards the concept of smart multi energy systems is needed. Optimal planning, design and operation of such energy systems, which efficiently integrate different energy sources, vectors and needs, is intrinsically a multi-objective problem in terms of sustainability. In this study, a decision support system based on performance indicators and Pareto multi-objective optimization is developed. System design combines renewable energy sources and combined cooling heat and power serving a cluster of firms through district energy distribution networks. Results show that the model enables the analysis of the trade-off between the different objective functions, allowing to identify the optimal energy systems layout through the selection of the proper size of the generation units. It also provides design directions such as the thermal energy storage capacity. The case study evidences that the smart energy systems concept can really represent a main opportunity to industrial districts both from the sustainability and the competitiveness perspective. Research also suggests that some financial incentives should be studied so that the solution providing the largest energy saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction could improve its economic attractiveness. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper suggests a new stochastic expert framework to investigate the charging effect of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) on the optimal operation and management of micro-grids (MGs). In this way, a useful method based on smart charging approach is proposed to consider the charging demand of PHEVs in both residential location and public charging stations. The analysis is simulated for 24h considering the uncertainties associated with the forecast error in the charging demand of PHEVs, hourly load consumption, hourly energy price and Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) output power. In order to see the effect of storage devices on the operation of the MG, NiMH-Battery is also incorporated in the MG. According to the high complexity of the problem, a new optimization method called θ-krill herd (θ-KH) algorithm is proposed which uses the phase angle vectors to update the velocity/position of krill animals with faster and more stable convergence. In addition, a new modification method is proposed to improve the search ability of the algorithm, effectively. The suggested problem is examined on an MG including different RESs such as photovoltaic (PV), fuel cells (FCs), wind turbine (WT), micro turbine (MT) and battery as the storage device. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper proposes a predictive techno-economic analysis in terms of voltage stability and cost using regression-based machine learning (ML) models and effectiveness of the analysis is validated. Predictive analysis of a power system is proposed to address the need for faster and accurate analyses that would aid in the operation and control of modern power system. Several methods of analyses including metaheuristic optimization algorithms, artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning algorithms are being developed and used. Predictive ML models for two modified IEEE 14-bus and IEEE-30 bus systems, integrated with renewable energy sources (solar and wind) and reactive power compensative device (STATCOM) are proposed and developed with features that include hour of the day, solar irradiation, wind velocity, dynamic grid price and system load. An hour-wise input database for the model development is generated from monthly average data and hour-wise daily curves with normally distributed standard deviations. The data feasibility tests and output database generation is performed using MATLAB. Linear and higher order polynomial regression models are developed for the 8760hr database using Python 3.0 in JupyterLab and a best-fit predictive ML model is identified by analysing the coefficients of determination. The voltage stability and cost predictive ML models were tested for a 24hr input profile. The results obtained and the comparison with the expected values are furnished. Prediction of the outputs for the test data validate the accuracy of the developed model.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Applying the new generation of artificial intelligence in smart grid and Energy Internet, to achieve high proportion renewable energy access to the power grid in a timely and effective manner, the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on deep learning is applied in the optimized operation of active distribution network (ADN). Firstly, DDPG return function of optimization model for ADN with multiple microgrids is constructed, which can minimize the total node voltage deviation and line loss of ADN. The proposed function can also minimize the variation of the power regulation of microgrid to reduce the impact on operation of the microgrid, and maintain the balance of tie-line power blance to reduce the impact on the distribution network. Secondly, DDPG sample data processing, design of return function, model training and learning process of optimization control for ADN are analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the improved IEEE 14-bus example simulation. © 2020 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.

AB  - The world is consuming large amounts of energy in various forms like electric energy and mechanical energy. Since the electrical energy is an important factor for the development of the world, many researchers tried to generate electricity from renewable energy sources collected by sensors in order to overcome the shortage of electrical energy for household appliances and industrial areas. In this paper, we develop Internet-of-Things (IoT) based system to generate electrical energy from multiple sensors for household appliances and industrial areas. Different sensors namely piezoelectric sensor, body heat to electric converter and solar panel are utilized and connected to the power storage circuit for generation of electrical energy. Two different Artificial Intelligence (AI) models such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) are utilized for the total power generated from renewable energy resources. Validation is done through the statistical parameters such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R2 coefficient of correlation. Result outcome from the models shows that ANN performance is better than ANFIS. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery. All rights reserved.

AB  - An accurate forecast of the exploitable energy from Renewable Energy Sources is extremely important for the stability issues of the electric grid and the reliability of the bidding markets. This paper presents a comparison among different forecasting methods of the photovoltaic output power introducing a new method that mixes some peculiarities of the others: the Physical Hybrid Artificial Neural Network and the five parameters model estimated by the Social Network Optimization. In particular, the day-ahead forecasts evaluated against real data measured for two years in an existing photovoltaic plant located in Milan, Italy, are compared by means both new and the most common error indicators. Results reported in this work show the best forecasting capability of the new “mixed method” which scored the best forecast skill and Enveloped Mean Absolute Error on a yearly basis (47% and 24.67%, respectively). © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Operational research has made meaningful contributions to practical forecasting in organizations. An area of substantial activity has been in nonlinear modeling. Based on Particle Swarm Optimization, we discuss a nonlinear method where a self-adaptive approach, named as Particle Swarm Optimization with aging and weakening factors, was applied to training a Focused Time Delay Neural Network. Three freely available benchmark datasets were used to demonstrate the features of the proposed approach compared to the Backpropagation algorithm, Differential Evolution and the Particle Swarm Optimization method when applied for training the artificial neural network. Even acknowledging that the effort in comparing methods across multiple empirical datasets is certainly substantial, the proposed algorithm was used to produce 30 min, 1, 3 and 6 h ahead predictions of wind speed at one site in Brazil. The use of the proposed algorithm goes further than only training the artificial neural network, but also searching the best number of hidden neurons and number of lags. The results have shown that the modified Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm obtained better results in all predictions horizons, and the use of it has remarkably reduced the training time. © 2017, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.

AB  - Energy efficiency measures in buildings can provide for a significant reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A sustainable design and planning of technologies for energy production should be based on economic and environmental criteria. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to quantify the environmental impacts over the whole cycle of life of production plants. Optimization models can support decisions that minimize costs and negative impacts. In this work, a multi-objective decision problem is formalized that takes into account LCA calculations and that minimizes costs and GHG emissions for general buildings. A decision support system (DSS) is applied to a real case study in the Northern Italy, highlighting the advantage provided by the installation of renewable energy. Moreover, a comparison among different optimal and non optimal solution was carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DSS. © 2016 by the authors.

AB  - To minimize the anticipated shocks to economic, environmental, and social systems for developing and least developed countries, the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is mandatory to a large extend. The nuclear-renewable integrated system is proficient in optimal energy distribution to multiple production schemes to reduce GHG emissions and maximize profit. This paper addresses the hybridization of the micronuclear reactor and Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) Energy Sources (RESs) to develop a flexible, cost-effective, sustainable, and resilient off-grid Hybrid Energy System (HES). The paper presents three types of hybridization methods, termed ‘‘Direct Coupling,’’ ‘‘Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling,’’ and ‘‘Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling.’’ The hybridization techniques are used to plan and identify the most efficient Nuclear-Renewable Micro-Hybrid Energy System (N-R MHES). The sizing, performance, and characterization of N-R MHES solely depend on the RES and load characteristics’ availability. Based on proposed hybridization techniques, mathematical modeling of N-R MHES’s economy is carried out in the MATLAB environment. An artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used to minimize the Net Present Cost (NPC) and achieve the optimal system configurations of different N-R MHESs. The simulation results determine that ‘‘Multiple Resources and Multiple Products-based N-R MHES’’ provides around 1.8 times and 1.3 times lower NPC than ‘‘Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling’’ and ‘‘Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling,’’ respectively, with an acceptable margin of reliability. A sensitivity analysis has also been conducted in this paper to strengthen the findings of the study. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Densely deployment of various small-cell base stations in cellular networks to increase capacity will lead to heterogeneous networks (HetNets), and meanwhile, embedding the energy harvesting capabilities in base stations as an alternative energy supply is becoming a reality. How to make efficient utilization of radio resource and renewable energy is a brand-new challenge. This paper investigates the optimal policy for user scheduling and resource allocation in HetNets powered by hybrid energy with the purpose of maximizing energy efficiency of the overall network. Since wireless channel conditions and renewable energy arrival rates have stochastic properties and the environment's dynamics are unknown, the model-free reinforcement learning approach is used to learn the optimal policy through interactions with the environment. To solve our problem with continuous-valued state and action variables, a policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithm is proposed. The actor part uses the Gaussian distribution as the parameterized policy to generate continuous stochastic actions, and the policy parameters are updated with the gradient ascent method. The critic part uses compatible function approximation to estimate the performance of the policy and helps the actor learn the gradient of the policy. The advantage function is used to further reduce the variance of the policy gradient. Using the numerical simulations, we demonstrate the convergence property of the proposed algorithm and analyze network energy efficiency. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Smart scheduling of energy consuming devices in the domestic sector should factor in clean energy generation potential, electricity tariffs, and occupants' behaviour (i.e., interactions with their appliances). The paper presents an Artificial Neural Network/Genetic Algorithm (ANN-GA) smart appliance scheduling approach for optimised energy management in the domestic sector. The proposed approach reduces energy demand in "peak" periods, maximises use of renewable sources (PV and wind turbine), while reducing reliance on grid energy. Comprehensive parameter optimisation has been carried out for both ANN and GA to find the best combinations, resulting in optimum weekly schedules. The proposed artificial intelligence techniques involve a holistic understanding of (near) real-time energy demand and supply within a domestic context to deliver optimised energy usage with minimum computational needs. The solution is stress-tested and demonstrated in a four bedroom house with grid energy usage reduction by 10%, 25%, and 40%, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The global ambitions of a carbon-neutral society necessitate a stable and robust smart grid that capitalizes on frequency reserves of renewable energy. Frequency reserves are resources that adjust power production or consumption in real time to react to a power grid frequency deviation. Revenue generation motivates the availability of these resources for managing such deviations. However, limited research has been conducted on data-driven decisions and optimal bidding strategies for trading such capacities in multiple frequency reserves markets. We address this limitation by making the following research contributions. Firstly, a generalized model is designed based on an extensive study of critical characteristics of global frequency reserves markets. Secondly, three bidding strategies are proposed, based on this market model, to capitalize on price peaks in multi-stage markets. Two strategies are proposed for non-reschedulable loads, in which case the bidding strategy aims to select the market with the highest anticipated price, and the third bidding strategy focuses on rescheduling loads to hours on which highest reserve market prices are anticipated. The third research contribution is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based bidding optimization framework that implements these three strategies, with novel uncertainty metrics that supplement data-driven price prediction. Finally, the framework is evaluated empirically using a case study of multiple frequency reserves markets in Finland. The results from this evaluation confirm the effectiveness of the proposed bidding strategies and the AI-based bidding optimization framework in terms of cumulative revenue generation, leading to an increased availability of frequency reserves. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) for multi-objective dispatch of an electric microgrid considering cost of operation, peak load reduction, and emissions. Discrete compromise programming (DCP) is used as the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) technique for providing the decision support to the distribution system operator (DSO) by ranking various alternatives based on preference of the objectives. The focus of this paper is the application of DCP-based MCDA to select feasible dispatch solutions closest to the preference of the DSO when multiple objectives are considered in the microgrid dispatch. This technique obtains non-dominated solutions in case of conflicting objectives without generating a Pareto front, and hence avoiding prohibitive computational cost. DCP can be used for MCDA in both exact and metaheuristic dispatch algorithms. Uncertainty in renewable energy forecasting and load demand is included through a scenario-based approach by sampling empirical distributions. The dispatch algorithm considers a two hour look-ahead time horizon. Simulations are performed on a notional electric microgrid with diesel generator, solar photovoltaic, and energy storage. The microgrid is based on the IEEE 13-node test feeder and the results are presented. © 2016

AB  - The environmental energy harvesting is adjudged as a reliable solution to power the wireless nodes for infinite time and assuring uninterrupted operation of deployed network nodes. But uncertain energy availability initiates an important research issue of energy management in rechargeable sensor nodes. An integrated approach of energy assignment principles with adaptive duty cycling has been proposed to efficiently utilize the available energy and to maximize the node performance. The R interface based machine learning ensemble approach has been used for solar irradiance prediction to pre-estimate the node duty cycle. Dynamic programming based optimization problem has been used for real time adaption of pre-computed node duty cycle. The effectiveness of proposed work has been validated using MATLAB interface by extensive simulations on real time solar energy profiles in terms of magnitude and stability of sensors average duty cycle. The proposed algorithm achieves an average duty cycle of 65% to 69% with a limit of 70% maximum duty cycle irrespective of irregular radiation patterns throughout the day as well as for different forecasting horizons. The results shows minimum variation in estimated and real time energy profiles in stable weather conditions and optimize the duty cycle in irregular weather conditions. The results also shows minimum variation (> 2 %) in estimated and real time energy profiles in stable weather conditions and optimize the duty cycle in irregular weather conditions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this paper, an intelligent technique for EMS based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with aid of Ant-Lion Optimizer (ALO) algorithm is presented to find energy scheduling in MG. The optimal operation programming of electrical systems through the minimization of production cost as well as better utilization of renewable energy resources, such as the PV system, WT, and storage system. The objective of the proposed method is utilized to the optimum operation of micro-sources for decreasing the electricity production cost by hourly day-ahead and real-time scheduling. The proposed method is able to analyze the technical and economic time-dependent constraints. The proposed method attempts to meet the required load demand with minimum energy cost. To accomplish this aim, demand response (DR) is evaluated by utilizing the RNN and additional indices for evaluating customer response, such as consumers information based on the offered priority, DR magnitude, duration, and minimum cost of energy (COE). Finally, the ALO algorithm is developed to solve the economic dispatch issues for determining the generation, storage, and responsive load offers. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink working platform and their performances are tested with the existing methods such as GA, ABC, and BFA respectively. © 2018

AB  - The use of fossil resources for electricity production is one of the primary reasons for increasing greenhouse emissions and is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the electricity generation by wind and solar resources have had greater applicability in recent years. Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems (HRES) integrates renewable sources and storage systems, increasing the reliability of generators. For the sizing of HRES, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) stand out. This article presents the sizing of an HRES for the Colombian context, taking into account the energy consumption by three typical demands, four types of wind turbines, three types of solar panels, and a storage system for the system configuration. Two optimization approaches were set-up with both optimization strategies (i.e., GA and PSO). The first one implies the minimization of the Loss Power Supply Probability (LPSP). In contrast, the second one concerns adding the Total Annual Cost (TAC) or the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to the objective function. Results obtained show that HRES can supply the energy demand, where the PSO method gives configurations that are more adjusted to the considered electricity demands. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Inclusion of renewable energy resources with existing conventional generation resources summons revisit to optimization methods used in the field of generation scheduling. The Unit Commitment problem in itself is a highly convoluted problem governed by complex time varying constraints. It gets even more complicated when additional constraints are added due to inclusion of renewable generation backed up by battery storage system. An effort has been made in this paper to improve the model for solving the Unit Commitment problem of conventional thermal generation in conjunction with renewable energy based generation system with storage. A hybrid artificial intelligence based multiple stage solution methodology is envisaged to provide a techno-economical optimal solution to the problem. The proposed methodology provides economically better solution to the Unit Commitment problem of ten thermal generators when integrated with battery supported wind and solar generation. The overall operational cost gets reduced due to integration of renewable resources which gets further reduced by incorporating battery with a novel optimized charge/discharge scheduling technique. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Renewable resources have drawn attention because of their role in reducing pollution and improving technical issues. It is notable that simultaneous use of several resources in the form of hybrid systems requires studying many different aspects involved. One of the most important issues of hybrid systems is system optimality. Therefore, the most effective approach is to combine components to minimize the cost. Different approaches have been proposed for determining the size of hybrid system components to optimize the proposed system. These methods are classified into three categories: classic, artificial intelligence, and computer program methods. In this paper, the optimal size of components was obtained using Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) method. Outputs of this algorithm were compared with two other algorithms and the advantage of this method was demonstrated. This paper achieved better responses in a shorter amount of time.  © 2020 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Economic dispatch (ED) is an essential part of any power system network. ED is howto schedule the real power outputs from the available generators to get the minimum cost while satisfying all constraints of the network. Moreover, it may be explained as allocating generation among the committed units with the most effective minimum way in accordance with all constraints of the system. There are many traditional methods for solving ED, e.g., Newton-Raphson method Lambda-Iterative technique, Gaussian-Seidel method, etc. All these traditional methods need the generators' incremental fuel cost curves to be increasing linearly. But practically the input-output characteristics of a generator are highly non-linear. This causes a challenging non-convex optimization problem. Recent techniques like genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence, dynamic programming and particle swarm optimization solve nonconvex optimization problems in a powerful way and obtain a rapid and near global optimum solution. In addition, renewable energy resources as wind and solar are a promising option due to the environmental concerns as the fossil fuels reserves are being consumed and fuel price increases rapidly and emissions are getting higher. Therefore, the world tends to replace the old power stations into renewable ones or hybrid stations. In this paper, it is attempted to enhance the operation of electrical power system networks via economic dispatch. An ED problem is solved using various techniques, e.g., Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique and Sine-Cosine Algorithm (SCA). Afterwards, the results are compared. Moreover, case studies are executed using a photovoltaic-based distributed generator with constant penetration level on the IEEE 14 bus system and results are observed. All the analyses are performed on MATLAB software.  © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - Electricity market forces and renewable energy integration promote the exchange of large power volumes over long distances, push the grid to operate closer to its limits, and make it vulnerable to cascading outages, e.g., triggered by disconnections of overloaded lines. During such emergencies, system operators need to redistribute power quickly and adequately. This paper presents a heuristic decision support system for alleviating line overloads and mitigating the consequences of cascading events. A graph-partitioning algorithm is developed to identify the subnetworks for which the overloaded lines act as power gates. Inter-subnetwork power shifts by generation rescheduling and, possibly, load shedding are applied to relieve the overloaded lines which bridge these subnetworks. The power shifts are selected based on their potential to simultaneously reduce overloads and prevent new ones. This multi-objective decision making is based on the sensitivities of the overloaded lines with respect to power shifts and on the time required to complete them. Line overloads are eliminated by guiding the formation of self-sufficient subnetworks. The framework has been tested on the modified RTS-96 and on the IEEE 118 systems to illustrate its capability of load shedding reduction using a developed cascading outages simulation model. A novel optimization method which minimizes the redispatch time is formulated to validate the proposed framework, and the impact of considering ramping rates is shown with comparison to standard optimization based on minimizing redispatch power. The sensitivity-based method identifies compromise solutions which minimize the redispatch power and the redispatch time, and support the dispatcher's decision making by providing further corrective actions alternative to normal OPF. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The deregulation of the electricity sector has culminated in the introduction of competitive markets. In addition, the emergence of new forms of electric energy production, namely the production of renewable energy, has brought additional changes in electricity market operation. Renewable energy has significant advantages, but at the cost of an intermittent character. The generation variability adds new challenges for negotiating players, as they have to deal with a new level of uncertainty. In order to assist players in their decisions, decision support tools enabling assisting players in their negotiations are crucial. Artificial intelligence techniques play an important role in this decision support, as they can provide valuable results in rather small execution times, namely regarding the problem of optimizing the electricity markets participation portfolio. This paper proposes a heuristic method that provides an initial solution that allows metaheuristic techniques to improve their results through a good initialization of the optimization process. Results show that by using the proposed heuristic, multiple metaheuristic optimization methods are able to improve their solutions in a faster execution time, thus providing a valuable contribution for players support in energy markets negotiations. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a selective survey of papers, books, and reports that articulate recent trends of Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) of integrated renewable energy systems (IRES). The time-period under consideration is 2008 through 2020. This is done to provide an up-to-date review of the recent, major advancements in the SCED, and state-of-the-art since 2008. This helps identify further challenges needed in adopting smarter grids, and indicate ways to address these challenges. The study was conducted in three areas of interest that are relevant for articulating the recent trends of SCED. These areas are (i) SCED of power systems with IRES, (ii) SCED mathematical formulation and solution methods, and (iii) SCED challenges. The review results and research directions deduce that the state of the art research is not enough and needs special attention on following the path of artificial intelligence-based optimization. © 2020 Shewit Tsegaye et al., licensed to EAI.

AB  - Recently, global research is giving more attention to the renewable energy sources due to its sustainability and environmentally friendly nature. The necessity of DC to AC conversion to integrate these sources to the well established AC power system create a significant development of multi-level inverter with its advantages of operating at higher rating system with lower component rating as well as better harmonics performance at it output voltage and current. In this research paper, a modified topology of CHB-MLI to provide 13-level output AC waveform is proposed based on the SHE-PWM strategy using the ANN optimization technique. The system modeling is done with Matlab Simulink software and verification are carried out by both simulation and experiment. Results show that the ANN technique able to reduce the THD significantly as the level of waveform is increased as low as 5.16% THD for the 13-level output voltage. Results from the experiment shows a good agreement with the simulation, thus verifying the effectiveness of the proposed ANN technique as an optimization method. © 2020 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Nanotechnology has brought huge impacts to our modern life in many ways. The technology has been adapted in various domains such as biotechnology, chemicals, computing, electronics, metals, materials, renewable energy and also telecommunications. This research is focusing on the RF magnetron sputtering process, one of the nanotechnology processes which are widely used in the thin film technology. The conventional method that is currently practiced in the optimization of the RF magnetron sputtering process parameters is trial and error method. However, the practice of repetitively conducting experiments has consumed a lot of time and cost in the thin film construction. This research is proposing artificial intelligence (AI) technique as the alternative technique to overcome the sputtering process parameter optimization problem. Three artificial intelligence techniques have been selected to solve this parameter optimization problem. The techniques are Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). In the process parameter optimization, automated process has never been implemented to optimize the six deposition parameters of the RF magnetron sputtering. Based on the results, GA has shown the best performance compared to PSO and GSA in terms of the fitness value and processing time. Laboratory results have shown that GA has produced the highest values of electrical and optical properties of thin film. It is expected that AI techniques could complement theconventional method of trial and error in obtaining the optimized process parameter combination. © 2017 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia.

AB  - The increasing penetration of Microgrids (MGs) into existing power systems and 'plug and play' capability of Distributed Generators (DGs) causes large overshoots and settling times along with various power quality issues such as voltage and frequency flickers, current harmonics and short current transients. In this context, over the past few years, considerable research has been undertaken to investigate and address the mentioned issues using different control schemes in conjunction with soft computational techniques. The recent trends and advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led the development of Swarm Intelligence (SI) based optimized controllers for smooth Renewable Energy Sources (RES) penetration and optimal voltage, frequency, and power-sharing regulation. Moreover, the recent studies have proved that the SI-based controllers provide enhanced dynamic response, optimized power quality and improved the dynamic stability of the MG systems as compared to the conventional control methods. Their importance in modern AC MG architectures can be judged from the growing number of publications in the recent past. However, literature, pertaining to SI applications to AC MG, is scattered with no comprehensive review on this significant development. As such, this study provides an overview of 15 different SI optimization techniques as applied to AC MG controls from 43 research publications including a detailed review of one of the elementary and most widely used SI based metaheuristic optimization algorithms called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. This comprehensive review provides a valuable one-stop source of knowledge for the researchers and experts working on SI controller's applications for AC MG dynamic response and power quality improvements. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The fast construction times of projects based on variable generation technologies (VGTs) such as photovoltaic and wind generation, together with growing difficulties for building new transmission lines due to socio-environmental requirements, have opened new challenges in the development of sustainable power systems. Due to the complexity of the Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP) problem, current models are usually oversimplified and do not always meet the requirements needed for the practical application. Examples of these simplifications are the use of reduced network equivalents, limiting the planning horizon to one or a few years and limiting the expansion options to adding new lines in given corridors. To meet the new challenges and achieve a time-effective increase of the transmission capacity for the integration of VGTs, improved models and algorithms capable of taking into account a higher degree of detail in the TNEP problem are needed. In this article, a novel meta-heuristic multi-year TNEP model based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is presented. One of the main characteristics of the model is that it enables us to consider simultaneously further expansion options such as line reconductoring, voltage uprating, and adding series compensation to lines. We tested the proposed ACO model with the Garver's 6-bus test system and a modified version of the IEEE 118-bus test system, assuming a significant incorporation of VGTs. The results obtained for a 15-year planning task show (i) an excellent performance of the model in terms of quality of the obtained solution and computational times, compared to the traditional MILP approach, and (ii) including line uprating options within the multi-year TNEP brings significant benefits such as reducing the total investment and congestion costs of the system as well as the number of lines to be built. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The operation and control of electricity in distribution networks has faced great challenges as a large number of distributed generations (DGs) are integrated. Connection of distributed generations (DGs) in the distribution system offers advantages in terms of reducing distribution and transmission costs as well as encouraging the use of renewable energy sources. The power flow in the distribution systems is no longer moving in a single direction and this resulted the system to become as active distribution networks (ADN). One of the main problems in ADN is the voltage regulation issue which is to maintain the voltage to be within its permissible limits. Several methods of voltage control methods are available and focus is given in finding the optimal voltage control using artificial intelligence techniques. This paper presents an optimal and coordinated voltage control method while minimizing losses and voltage deviation of the network. The optimal and coordinated voltage control scheme is implemented on an IEEE 13 bus distribution network for loss and voltage deviation minimization in the networks. Firefly Algorithm (FA) which is a known heuristic optimization technique for finding the optimal solution is used in this work. The results are compared with another optimization method known as Backtracking Search Algorithm (BSA) for identifying the best setting for solving the voltage regulation problem. In order to solve the multi-objective optimization issue, the MATPOWER load flow simulation is integrated in the MATLAB environment with the optimization algorithm.

AB  - The characteristics of power produced from photovoltaic (PV) and Wind systems are based on the weather condition. Both the system are very unreliable in itself without sufficient capacity storage devices like batteries or back-up system like conventional engine generators. The reliability of the system significantly increases when two systems are hybridized with the provision of storage device. Even in such case, sufficient battery bank capacity is required to provide power to the load in extended cloudy days and non-windy days. Therefore the optimal sizing of system component represents the important part of hybrid power system. This paper summarizes recent trends of energy usage from renewable sources. It discusses physical modeling of renewable energy systems, several methodologies and criteria for optimization of the Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES). HRES is getting popular in the present scenario of energy and environmental crises. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review on the current state of optimization techniques specifically suited for the small and isolated power system based on the published literatures. The recent trend in optimization in the field of hybrid renewable energy system shows that artificial intelligence may provide good optimization of system without extensive long term weather data. © 2015 Korean Society for Precision Engineering.
