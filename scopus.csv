The investigation employs ceramic membranes for oxygen, vapor, and carbon dioxide distribution within the reactor bed. A differential evolution algorithm is utilized alongside cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and support vector regression (SVR) to determine optimal values for O2/CH4, H2O/CH4, and CO2/CH4 ratios, membrane thickness, and shell pressure, with hydrogen yield as the objective function. Results demonstrate that the oxygen membrane reactor achieves the highest hydrogen yield, reaching 2.02 and 1.75 for direct methanol synthesis and Fischer–Tropsch processes, respectively, representing a 7.98 % and 10.03 % increase compared to the conventional tri-reforming reactor. Furthermore, CSA and SVR emerge as invaluable tools, facilitating robust optimization and predictive modeling. The CSA efficiently navigates complex solution spaces to identify optimal parameters, while SVR accurately models relationships between input variables and hydrogen yield. Incorporating these methodologies enhances the effectiveness of membrane reactor design and synthesis gas production.

To address this issue, data-driven techniques have emerged as a promising approach for lithium-ion battery (LIB) degradation analysis and estimation. This paper focuses on the application of incremental capacity curves (ICCs) in battery degradation analysis using data-driven techniques. The incremental capacity curve is a powerful tool that provides valuable insights into the capacity degradation of a battery. By analyzing the changes in the ICC over time, it is possible to identify and quantify battery degradation phenomena such as capacity fade, impedance growth, and aging effects. However, manually analyzing ICCs can be time-consuming and subjective, leading to potential errors and inconsistencies. To overcome these challenges, hyperparameter-tuned Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) techniques are employed to automate the analysis of ICCs and extract meaningful degradation information. These techniques leverage statistical models to process large volumes of ICC data and identify degradation patterns. By training these models on historical data, they can accurately predict battery degradation and estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of a battery. Further, to enhance the performance of estimation of RUL of the battery. A hyperparameter-tuned LSTM technique has been proposed. The proposed technique has been compared with well-known techniques (i.e. Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Sparse MLP, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). The results depict that the proposed robust LSTM technique outperforms well in terms of computational cost and speed. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique, error analysis has been carried out. The simulation and experimental results depict that the proposed hyperparameter-tuned LSTM model results in very low error indices such as RMSE, MEA, and MAPE as 0.0246, 0.0159 and 1.03 compared with models such as MLP, Sparse MLP and CNN. The proposed hyperparameter-tuned LSTM technique depicts a lesser error. By leveraging machine learning and statistical models. The results of this study contribute to the advancement of battery management systems and the optimization of battery usage in various applications.

This study emphasizes the critical process of accurately tracking the maximum power points with the characteristic curves of photovoltaic (PV) modules under real-time, diverse partial shading patterns. It explores the various stages of the tracking process and the methodologies employed for optimization. While conventional methods show effectiveness, they often fall short in swiftly and accurately tracking maximum power points with minimal errors. To address this limitation, this research introduces a novel machine learning approach known as adaptive reinforcement learning with neural network architecture (ARL-NNA) for MPPT. The results obtained from ARL-NNA are compared with existing algorithms using the same experimental data. Furthermore, the outcomes are validated through different factors and processing time measurements. The findings conclusively demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed algorithm in effectively tracking maximum power points in PV characteristic curves, providing a promising solution for optimizing solar energy generation in partial shading patterns.

To implement this necessity, a two-stage framework is proposed that involves demand forecasting and an optimization model to optimize the location and pricing of CSs. The first stage employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to forecast the 30-day energy demand for CSs using historical data from New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The energy demand is integrated into a bilevel optimization problem modeled as a Stackelberg game. Considering the energy demand, the leader in the game strategically selects the locations for new CSs, while the followers determine their charging prices at each location to maximize payoffs. In this article, an in-depth theoretical and analytical analysis of the potential new locations is performed to understand the demand and profitability at these locations. Moreover, a detailed game theoretic analysis is presented, considering both static and dynamic games to illustrate their impact on the payoff of CSs. Furthermore, a penalty function is designed at the follower end to limit the charging prices within reasonable bounds to improve the social welfare of the market mechanism.

However, weather fluctuations challenge the efficiency of solar systems, making maximum power point tracking (MPPT) systems crucial for optimal energy harvesting. This study compares ten MPPT approaches, including both conventional and artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques. These controllers were designed and implemented using MATLAB Simulink, and their performance was evaluated under real environmental conditions with fluctuating irradiance and temperature. The results demonstrate that conventional techniques, such as incremental conductance (INC), Perturb and Observe (P&O), Incremental conductance and Particle Swam Optimization (INC-PSO), Fuzzy Logic Control and Particle Swam Optimization (FLC-PSO), and Perturb and Observe and Particle Swam Optimization (P&O-PSO), achieved accuracies of 94%, 97.6%, 98.9%, 98.7%, and 99.3% respectively.

Compared to available research, which often reports lower accuracies for conventional techniques, our study highlights the enhanced performance of AI-based methods.

Multi-area MGs will emerge as a result, and issues related to them will need to be addressed. Load frequency control (LFC) is a challenge in such structures, which are more complicated due to variations in demand and the stochastic characteristics of renewable energy sources. This paper presents a cascade fuzzy active disturbance rejection control technique to deal with the LFC problem. In order to tune different parameters of controllers, a newly developed heuristic algorithm called the Gazelle optimization algorithm (GOA) is also employed. Moreover, due to the fact that multi-area MGs are regarded as cyber-physical systems (CPSs), a relatively new concern for LFC problems is their resilience to cyberattacks such as false data injection (FDI) and denial of service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, this research also presents a novel machine learning approach called parallel attack resilience detection system (PARDS) to deal with the LFC problem in the presence of cyberattacks. The efficiency of the proposed strategy is investigated under different scenarios, such as non-linearities in the power system or server cyberattacks. © 2024 The Author(s).

These uncertainties require consideration in power flow analyses by calculating power flow across a spectrum of generation and load values. Traditional power flow methods, which rely on iterative solutions of non-linear equation sets, become computationally burdensome under these uncertain conditions. Surrogate models have been used to reduces the computational cost of power flow analysis under uncertainty. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained increasing attention as surrogates for power system simulations. However, GNNs, similar to other machine learning models, require significant amounts of training data. This paper proposes an innovative approach combining a multi-fidelity methodology with a GNN-based surrogate model for efficient power flow calculations. This model is trained using both high-fidelity power flow simulations and low-fidelity power flow simulations. Our multi-fidelity GNN model not only reduces the cost of generating training data, but also outperforms both single-fidelity GNN models trained solely on high-fidelity data and conventional neural network models. Additionally, the proposed model exhibits robustness to minor topology changes and achieves reasonable performance with unseen topologies. The model's effectiveness is validated through simulations on standard IEEE systems. © 2024","Graph neural network; Multi-fidelity data fusion; Power flow analysis; Renewable energy generation; Varying topology","Demand response; Load flow control; Efficient power; Graph neural networks; Multi fidelities; Multi-fidelity data fusion; Neural network model; Power flow analyze; Power flows; Renewable energy generation; Uncertainty; Varying topologies; Load flow optimization","N.

Power systems are challenged by high penetrations of RE, including frequent wind curtailments and uncertain RE resources threatening their security. A 2-step scheme for MES is proposed in the study to generate reliable operational decisions by incorporating integrated heat-electricity demand response (DR). In the initial phase, dynamic programming was applied to determine the optimal solution for previous linkage sessions. Subsequently, machine learning techniques were trained using historical data and the resulting optimal decisions to make optimal real-time decisions without prior knowledge of future power costs or vehicle usage. An accurately trained deep neural network is capable of significantly reducing charging costs, usually approaching the retrospectively calculated optimum charging price. In the suggested scheme, the operating prices are minimized under a base scenario ensuring that no constraint is violated regardless of the scenario. RE curtailment can be reduced significantly with power-to-gas (P2G) devices that convert excess energy from wind and photovoltaic sources into natural gas. In addition, this paper proposes integrated heat-electric DR as a means of reducing operating prices and enhancing security against uncertainties by employing couplings between different systems. The outcomes show that robust optimization enhances the security of systems, and the unified electric-heat DR can boost the use of RE while improving the economic benefit. It should be noted that this paper investigated under the impact of the climate changes and also socioeconomic dynamics that can change consuming energy in urban systems. © 2023","Deep learning; Demand response model; Hybrid electric-heat systems; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling","Climate change; Climate models; Deep learning; Dynamic programming; Fossil fuels; Learning systems; Operating costs; Deep learning; Demand response; Demand response model; Heat systems; Hybrid electric-heat system; Multi-energy systems; Renewable energies; Response model; Scheduling; Socio-economics; adaptive management; alternative energy; climate change; electricity supply; machine learning; model; socioeconomic conditions; statistical analysis; urban area; Renewable energy resources","Y.

This article proposes an innovative model based on digital twin technology to solve the supply–demand mismatch problem in geothermal heating systems. This model achieves multi-objective optimization of comprehensive cost, geothermal energy utilization rate, and carbon emission by constructing a heat storage geothermal heating system. Digital twin technology integrates data and information models of public buildings and facilitates their sharing and transmission throughout the entire lifecycle of the geothermal heating system.

Within this realm, ejector types that harness renewable energy resources emerge as promising alternatives, offering a pathway towards environmentally conscious and resilient energy practices. Under specific conditions, condensation within the heat exchanger results in diverse droplet sizes at the ejector inlet, inducing homogeneous-heterogeneous condensation (HMTC) and heterogeneous condensation (HTC) phenomena. This study aims to evaluate and improve the performance of steam ejectors by investigating and optimizing the effects of homogeneous condensation (HMC), HTC, HMTC, and evaporation processes using a machine learning (ML) framework. The drone squadron optimization (DSO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) are chosen and used in the ML framework to find the optimal droplet radius and number. Findings predict that the presence of 1018 1/kg droplets with a radius of 0.02 μm (Optimal mode) at the inlet results in a 2.6 % increase in the entrainment ratio (Er) and a 6.9 % reduction in the entropy generation compared to the baseline mode.

This study presents an adaptive robust unit commitment approach using machine learning techniques for renewable power systems, computing the Calinski-Harabasz index to identify prediction inaccuracies related to intermittent sources. The uncertainties are subsequently grouped together using the spatial clustering tool, and the average density of the K-means distribution is calculated. The clustering of points in space, considering noise, discrete uncertainty in renewable energy sources, and outliers within the comprehensive uncertainty set, is addressed via a nonparametric algorithm. The implementation of established methodologies and frameworks, in conjunction with density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, introduces an innovative method for vulnerability clustering. This methodology guarantees that every cluster aligns with data pertaining to vulnerabilities of renewable energy sources. The performance of the suggested method is showcased by conducting experiments on modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus test systems that use intermittent wind power. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework may lower the cost of robustness by 8–48% compared to traditional robust optimization techniques.

However, there are some challenges, such as the fixed and unchangeable flow characteristic curve of the hydraulic turbines, and the large number of variables in optimal load distribution, which limit the progress of research. In this paper, we propose a new optimal method of the economic operation of hydropower stations based on improved Long Short-Term Memory neural network (I-LSTM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Firstly, in order to accurately estimate the water consumption, the LSTM model’s hyperparameters are optimized using improved particle swarm optimization, and the I-LSTM method is proposed to fit the flow characteristic curve of the hydraulic turbines. Secondly, the Random Forest machine learning algorithm is introduced to establish a load-distribution model with its powerful feature extraction and learning ability. To improve the accuracy of the load-distribution model, we use the K-means algorithm to cluster the historical data and optimize the parameters of the Random Forest model. A Hydropower Station in China is selected for a case study. It is shown that (1) the I-LSTM method fits the operating characteristics under various working conditions and actual operating characteristics of hydraulic turbines, ensuring that they are closest to the actual operating state; (2) the I-LSTM method is compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM). The prediction results of SVM have a large error, but compared with ELM and LSTM, MSE is reduced by about 46% and 38% respectively. MAE is reduced by about 25% and 21%, respectively. RMSE is reduced by about 27% and 24%, respectively; (3) the RF algorithm performs better than the traditional dynamic programming algorithm in load distribution. With the passage of time and the increase in training samples, the prediction accuracy of the Random Forest model has steadily improved, which helps to achieve optimal operation of the units, reducing their average total water consumption by 1.24%. This study provides strong support for the application of intelligent low-consumption optimization strategies in hydropower fields, which can bring higher economic benefits and resource savings to renewable energy production. © 2024 by the authors.","economic operation; energy production; hydropower; improved LSTM; Random Forest algorithm","","J.

However, the variable generation from renewable sources, such as photovoltaic systems, can lead to power peaks that impact the stability of the grid. This challenge is exacerbated by the increasing demand in fast-charging stations. Addressing these demand peaks is crucial to ensure the stability of the electrical grid. This paper introduces the predictive-flex smoother, an innovative method designed to mitigate power fluctuations in grid-connected photovoltaic systems while optimizing energy management in electric vehicle charging stations. The predictive-flex smoother method incorporates a hybrid energy storage system comprising supercapacitors and vanadium redox flow batteries to respond rapidly to electric vehicle charging stations demands, enhance grid electricity purchase optimization, and improve energy quality delivery. The proposed method integrates two control strategies: photovoltaic fluctuation reduction strategy and peak demand reduction strategy for electric vehicle charging stations. By leveraging prediction algorithms and machine learning techniques, the predictive-flex smoother method achieves precise power fluctuation forecasts, allowing efficient utilization of supercapacitors and vanadium redox flow batteries to smooth photovoltaic power fluctuations and reduce electrical vehicles peak demand. Comprehensive experimental investigations and simulations validate the method's performance under various operational conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictive-flex smoother method, significantly improving the quality of power delivered to the grid while reducing costs. The experimental platform, validates the real-time response of the proposed method, with response times under 500 ms. The experimental results further confirm the efficiency of the method in power smoothing and charging strategies with varying electrical vehicles models and connection coefficients. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle demand; Photovoltaic technology; Power fluctuations; Power smoothing; Renewable energy systems","Charging (batteries); Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Flow batteries; Machine learning; Power quality; Supercapacitor; Vanadium; Charging station; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle demand; Energy systems; Photovoltaic technology; Power; Power fluctuations; Power smoothing; Renewable energies; Renewable energy system; Renewable energy","F.

Distributed Generation (DG) based on renewable energy sources serves as a viable alternative solution for researchers to counter the issue of rising load. Hence the use of renewable energy sources is of utmost priority. Renewable non-traditional energy resources also have the advantage of being an unlimited energy source and climate-friendly in nature. In this context, distributed micro-generating units come into the picture, popularly known as MicroGrid (MG). The MGs are small-scale resources generating electrical energy and connected to the main utility through power electronic converters. The main drawbacks associated with MGs are their association with converters and switching devices, which leads to the injection of disturbances in the power system. Due to the tremendous use of MGs in modern power systems, the inherent intermittent nature of the renewable sources increased infiltration of nonlinear loads, and the distributed nature of micro-generating units, huge power quality (PQ) issues are observed hazardous to both generation and supply ends. PQ issues could be either the reactive power compensation or the generation of harmonics that hamper the normal functioning of the electrical energy system. To maintain healthy transmission and distribution of electrical power, these issues must be taken care of utmost priority. Because of customer satisfaction, utilities have adopted many profitable schemes and power quality improvement methods. In this regard, around 350 recent review articles have been comprehensively surveyed, and a detailed discussion about regulation of power quality issues using the filters, controllers, Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS), optimization techniques (OTs), and machine learning tools with modern and advanced control techniques have been highlighted in this review article. A clear idea regarding power quality and its enhancement in MG has been presented. The technical and economic aspects have also been projected in brief. In addition, an in-depth study covering all challenges has been cited, and possible solutions in the future for hassle-free PQ improvement have been suggested in detail. It is believed that this review article would serve as an efficient background for researchers, academicians, electrical engineers, industrialists, and manufacturers working towards the hassle-free operation of MGs by efficient PQ issues mitigation. © 2024 The Author(s)","Active power filter (APF); Distributed generation (DG); FACTS; Harmonics reduction; MicroGrid (MG); Optimization techniques (OTs); Power quality (PQ); Renewable energy","","S.

This paper presents a comprehensive approach to optimizing grid management by integrating Photovoltaic (PV), wind, and grid energies to minimize costs and enhance sustainability. A key focus lies in developing an accurate scheduling algorithm utilizing Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), enabling dynamic allocation of energy resources to meet demand while minimizing reliance on cost-intensive grid energy. An ensemble learning technique, specifically a stacking algorithm, is employed to construct a robust forecasting pipeline for PV and wind energy generation. The forecasting model achieves remarkable accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of less than 0.1 for short-term (15 min and one day ahead) and long-term (one week and one month ahead) predictions.

Photovoltaic power generation (PPG) has great potential as a renewable energy source to support sustainable development. However, the unpredictability of photovoltaics because of the uncertain weather conditions, time lags and the complex interactions among related factors may result in instabilities in PPG, which limits its applications in the electric power system. Therefore, accurately identifying the related factors and representing the interactions are the key issues in predicting PPG. For this purpose, a novel seasonal grey prediction model with time-lag and interactive effects, denoted as SGMLI(1,n), is developed to predict the capacity of photovoltaic power generation. More specifically, a time-lag driving term, a periodic driving term, and an interaction driving term are proposed to represent the lag relationship, periodicity, and the interactive effects between two factors, respectively. Utilizing the least square method and the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), the optimal solution to the nonlinear programming problem is estimated. For elaboration and verification, six grey forecasting models, two statistical techniques, and two machine learning models, are employed for comparison with the SGMLI(1,n) model. Experimental results reveal that the SGMLI(1,n) outperforms benchmark models in forecasting PPG. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Grey prediction model; Interactive effects; Periodic characteristics; Photovoltaic power generation; Time lags","Electric power systems; Least squares approximations; Nonlinear programming; Photovoltaic effects; Solar energy; Energy source; Grey prediction model; Human society; Interactive effect; Periodic characteristic; Photovoltaic power generation; Related factors; Renewable energy source; Time lag; Time-lag effect; algorithm; alternative energy; complexity; electrical power; photovoltaic system; power generation; prediction; Forecasting","L.

However, this strategy faces the challenges of high energy consumption, relatively low exergy efficiency, substantial economic costs, boil-off gas losses, and limited knowledge of its environmental perspectives. A robust systematic framework is introduced by integrating thermodynamic, machine learning (ML), and multiobjective optimization (MOO) approaches to optimize the operational variables of the H2 liquefaction process. The H2 liquefaction process includes a mixed refrigerant precooling unit and a Joule-Brayton cryogenic cascade cycle. The combination of the pinch analysis approach and enumerative algorithms is used in the initial optimization phase as a nonlinear method to determine the operational variables of the precooling and liquefaction systems. The exergy efficiency and exergy destruction of H2 liquefaction cycles are calculated as 49% and 5073 kW to produce 50 tons/day of liquid H2. Based on life cycle assessment and economic analysis, the global warming and levelized cost to produce 1 kg liquid H2 are calculated at 124 kgCO2eq and 4.833 US$, respectively. The sensitivity analysis, ML, and MOO algorithms (particle swarm, genetic algorithm, and gray wolf techniques) in the final optimization phase are used to determine the Pareto frontier. The multicriteria decision techniques are used to identify the optimal operating conditions considering the thermodynamic, economic, and environmental aspects.

However, as being widely used in practice, current Bayesian calibration is mostly performed in low-resolution (annual or monthly), instead of high-resolution (hourly or sub-hourly), which is crucial to support emerging BEM applications, such as building-renewable energy integration (demand response) and smart control. This is attributable to the gaps in current Bayesian calibration process, including (1) difficulty in supporting reliable high-resolution calibration with over-parameterization and multi-solution issues, (2) inadequacy of meta-model to capture temporal building dynamics in high-resolution, and (3) excessive computational burdens of covariance matrix calculation in Bayesian inference. Therefore, to close these gaps, this research proposes a novel deep learning-based Bayesian calibration framework, involving pre-calibration mechanism, Long Short-Term Memory as surrogate models, and simplified covariance matrix calculation, to calibrate BEMs in high temporal resolution (i.e., hourly) with enhanced accuracy and computational efficiency. The case study demonstrates its effectiveness to match modeling outcomes with measurements and realize CV-RMSE of < 30 % and NMBE of < 6 % in hourly resolution, as well as a significant reduction of calibration time (by > 99 %, from > 600 h to ∼ 1.5 h). © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian calibration; Bayesian optimization; Building energy modeling; Deep learning; Machine learning; Model calibration","Contrastive Learning; 'current; Bayesian calibration; Bayesian optimization; Building energy model; Covariance matrices; Deep learning; High resolution; Machine-learning; Model calibration; Resolution calibrations; Adversarial machine learning","J.

Distribution network operators face capacity limits set by regional grids, risking economic penalties if exceeded. This study examined data-driven approaches of load forecasting to address these challenges on a city scale through a use case study of Eskilstuna, Sweden. Multiple Linear Regression was used to model electric load data, identifying key calendar and meteorological variables through a rolling origin validation process, using three years of historical data. Despite its low cost, Multiple Linear Regression outperforms the more expensive non-linear Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and both outperform the “weekly Naïve” benchmark with a relative Root Mean Square Errors of 32–34% and 39–40%, respectively. Best-practice hyperparameter settings were derived, and they emphasize frequent re-training, maximizing the training data size, and setting a lag size larger than or equal to the forecast horizon for improved accuracy. Combining both models into an ensemble could the enhance accuracy.

However, existing research predominantly focuses on specific operating conditions, neglecting the fundamental principles governing stability evolution under time-varying operating conditions. This paper presents a methodology to develop the small-signal stability region (SSSR) for grid-connected inverters using the impedance method. A comprehensive stability analysis for grid-connected inverter systems is performed based on the stability region. Firstly, the multi-parameter SSSR of the grid-connected inverter is defined according to both the aggregated impedance criterion and the generalized Nyquist criterion. Furthermore, a polynomial approximation expression for the SSSR boundary is derived. Secondly, the sensitivity analysis of operating points and control parameters is performed under full operating conditions to investigate their impact on stability based on the quantified boundary. The analyses reveal that the stability of the grid-connected inverter system near the SSSR boundary decreases with increasing active power and decreasing reactive power but exhibits an initial increase followed by a decrease with a larger PLL bandwidth. Finally, the accuracy of the stability region and the influence of key parameters are verified through case studies and experiments. The study in this paper can be used for quantitative analysis of stability margins and decision guidance of control optimization for grid-connected inverters. © 2024","Aggregated impedance; Grid-connected inverter; Machine learning; Small-signal stability region; Stability analysis","Sensitivity analysis; Aggregated impedance; Grid-connected; Grid-connected inverter; Inverter system; Machine-learning; Operating condition; Small signal stability region; Stability analyze; Stability region boundary; Electric power system stability","P.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have gained much attention as a power generation source for various uses, including the primary utility grid power supply. There has been a significant increase in both on-grid and off-grid solar PV installations. Because of the highly unpredictable nature of solar power generation, it is crucial to forecast solar power accurately for renewable resources-based power systems. In this research, a swarm-based ensemble forecasting strategy has been proposed to predict solar PV power by combining three strategies, i.e., particle swarm optimization-based gated recurrent unit (PSO-GRU), PSO-based long short-term memory (PSO-LSTM), and PSO-based bidirectional long short-term memory (PSO-BiLSTM). Bayesian model averaging (BMA) combines the output of the proposed strategy by aggregating the output of each swarm-based approach. The performance of the suggested approach is evaluated and verified using historical data of solar PV power which is acquired from Griffith University, Australia. Python 3.11 is used to validate the performance of the proposed ensemble strategy and compared it with several competing strategies.

The dynamic system faces challenges, such as intermittent power supply due to low inertia, renewable intermittence, plug-and-play prosumer activities, network topology variations, and a lack of constraint handling. These complexities pose significant issues in designing effective control for frequency regulation and consensus-based economic load dispatch (ELD) within DRES to meet varying load demands. To address the above challenges, this research employs a machine learning-based distributed multiagent consensus design that offers a rapid and robust approach, mitigating the limitations associated with the Distributed Average Integral (DAI) control design. The proposed multiagent scheme empowers the successful implementation of ELD and frequency regulation, accommodating the intermittent DRES, diverse network topologies, and the dynamic plug-and-play activities of prosumers. Moreover, an optimization-based DAI tuning model is introduced to overcome tuning limitations. Intelligent renewable energy agents are trained through machine learning-based regression models that use root mean square error metrics for performance evaluations.

In the comparison made in terms of processing speed, it was seen that the designed system reached the result faster by obtaining the result in 17 seconds, which the HOMER software obtained in 936 seconds in optimizing the same system. In the economic comparison, as a result of the optimization made by two different tools; There is a difference of 1.737% in Energy cost, 0.85% in Total Net Present Cost and 1.895% in Initial Capital, and there is no significant difference between the results. In the comparison of the electrical results, there is a difference of 0.031% for the fed loads and 1.071% for the unmet loads, and the reliability of the results in electrical terms has been demonstrated. The capacity shortage parameter was used for the first time in the optimization of renewable energy sources with the metaheuristic algorithm. Energy Cost is used as the objective function. In short, a unique and reliable optimization tool has been designed as an alternative to the HOMER program that can achieve much faster results and eliminates the sensitivity, cumbersomeness and difficult search space generation processes in the HOMER program.

However, the operation and control of ESS are not straightforward, given the ever-changing electricity prices in the market environment and the stochastic and intermittent nature of renewable energy generations, which respond to real-time load variations. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to address the electricity arbitrage problem associated with optimal ESS management. First, we analyze the structure of the optimal offline ESS control problem using the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. This formulation identifies optimal control actions to absorb excess renewable energy and perform price arbitrage strategies. To tackle the uncertainties inherent in the prediction data, we then recast the online ESS control problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework and develop the DRL approach, which involves integrating the optimal offline control solution obtained from the training data into the training process and introducing noise to the state transitions. Unlike typical offline DRL training over a long time interval, we employ the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms with smaller neural networks training over a short time interval. Numerical studies demonstrate the promising potential of the proposed DRL-enabled approach for achieving better online control performance than the model predictive control (MPC) method under different price errors. This highlights the sample efficiency and robustness of our DRL approaches in managing ESS for electricity arbitrage. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Deep reinforcement learning; Energy management; Energy storage; Renewable energy","Deep learning; Digital storage; Dynamic programming; E-learning; Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Energy management; Integer programming; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Model predictive control; Numerical methods; Predictive control systems; Stochastic systems; Structural optimization; Control problems; Deep reinforcement learning; Offline; Optimal solutions; Reinforcement learning approach; Reinforcement learnings; Renewable energies; Storage control; Storage systems; System control; algorithm; alternative energy; electricity; energy management; energy storage; linear programing; machine learning; market conditions; strategic approach; Reinforcement learning","C.

So, improving the stability of this semiconductor device is very important. One of the suggestions for improving the dynamic stability of this structure is choosing laminated composite layers with various angle ply as the metal layer. So, in this work, for the first time, absorbed energy capacity, and dynamics of improved perovskite solar cells via both mathematical modeling and a hybrid machine learning method is presented. Laminated composite layers are placed in the last layer of the solar cell so that it can improve the energy absorption and dynamics of this kind of semiconductor device. So, with this assumption, in the current work, absorbed energy capacity dynamic deflection and natural frequency sensitivity analysis of solar doubly curved cells with respect to geometrical and physical parameters is carried out. High-order shear deformation theory, which displays the parabolic transverse shear stresses throughout the thickness by satisfying the free surface requirements, is employed in this work to simulate the displacement field. The governing equations with varied boundary conditions are generated and solved, accordingly, using the virtual work principle and exact solution. After obtaining the dataset using mathematical simulation, a hybrid machine learning method using coupled support vector machine (SVM), genetic algorithm (GA), and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to test, train, and validate the outputs.

However, the scheduled programs may not comply with grid requirements or real-time conditions. To ensure grid stability and sufficient reserves, system operators procure resources on the Ancillary Services Market (ASM). With the increasing share of renewable energy sources, many programmable generators are shifting their business model, from generating energy at base load to providing grid services. In this context, a DAM-based traditional approach to dispatch scheduling, widely adopted by existing techno-economics analysis, may result significantly suboptimal. This paper presents a novel model for dispatch optimization maximizing profits simultaneously on both the DAM and ASM, utilizing a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation and a machine learning algorithm considering a pay-as-bid pricing system and predicting the probability of offer acceptance based on historical data. The proposed framework is modular and flexible, allowing for separate use of the MILP dispatch optimizer and the machine learning offer acceptance prediction model. A risk propensity factor is defined and the impact on the optimal bidding strategy, the expected profits, and their variability, is studied. A Montecarlo approach is used to evaluate the profits probability density function. The performance obtained (i.e. 20 min to optimize one week of operation of a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine) allows in applying the proposed methodologies for both long term energy system planning and daily production offer scheduling. © 2024","Ancillary service; Dispatch optimization; Energy market; Risk assessment","Electric load dispatching; Hydroelectric power plants; Integer programming; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Power markets; Probability density function; Profitability; Renewable energy; Risk analysis; Ancillary service; Ancillary services markets; Day ahead market; Dispatch optimization; Energy; Energy markets; Energy services; Mixed integer linear; Optimisations; Risks assessments; algorithm; alternative energy; electricity industry; energy market; integrated approach; machine learning; risk assessment; smart grid; technical efficiency; Risk assessment","A.

It was verified through standard testing functions that EIBWO performed better than comparative algorithms. Secondly, EIBWO was used to optimize the internal parameters of ELM and establish a PV power prediction model based on enhanced and improved beluga whale optimization algorithm–optimization extreme learning machine (EIBWO-ELM). Finally, the measured data of the PV output were used for verification, and the results show that the PV power prediction results of EIBWO-ELM were more accurate regardless of whether it was cloudy or sunny. The R2 of EIBWO-ELM exceeded 0.99, highlighting its efficient ability to adapt to PV power generation. The prediction accuracy of EIBWO-ELM is better than that of comparative models. Compared with existing models, EIBWO-ELM significantly improves the predictive reliability and economic benefits of PV power generation. This study not only provides a technological foundation for the optimization of intelligent energy systems but also contributes to the sustainable development of clean energy. © 2024 by the authors.","enhanced and improved beluga whale optimization; extreme learning machine; photovoltaic power prediction; varying meteorological conditions","Forecasting; Gas emissions; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Beluga whales; Enhanced and improved beluga whale optimization; Extreme learning machine; Learning machines; Meteorological condition; Optimisations; Photovoltaic power; Photovoltaic power prediction; Power predictions; Varying meteorological condition; Greenhouse gases","M.-L.

Moreover, traditional scheduling strategies often overlook the decay in prediction accuracy over time and lack a mechanism for establishing optimal forecasting horizons. This research addresses this gap by merging machine learning (ML) probabilistic forecasting with robust optimization to create optimal dispatch schedules for RES MGs. It reveals that longer scheduling horizons can reduce dispatch costs but at the expense of forecast accuracy due to increased prediction accuracy decay (PAD). To address this, we propose a novel method that determines how to split the time horizon into timeblocks to minimize dispatch costs and maximize forecast accuracy. This forms the basis of an optimal rolling horizon strategy (ORoHS) which schedules distributed energy resources over varying prediction/execution horizons. The model was evaluated on a simulated renewable microgrid with energy storage. Probabilistic forecasts were generated for wind, solar, and energy prices at different confidence levels. This data fed into a robust optimization model to schedule energy transactions. Results offer Pareto-optimal fronts, showing the trade-offs between cost and accuracy at varying confidence levels. Solar power proved more cost-effective than wind power due to lower variability, despite wind's higher energy output. The ORoHS strategy outperformed common scheduling methods. In the case study, it achieved a cost of $4.68 compared to $9.89 (greedy policy) and $9.37 (two-hour RoHS). © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable microgrids; Robust optimization; Rolling horizon strategies","Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electric load dispatching; Forecasting; Pareto principle; Solar energy; Wind power; Energy prices; Machine-learning; Microgrid; Prediction accuracy; Probabilistic forecasting; Renewable energy source; Renewable microgrid; Robust optimization; Rolling horizon; Rolling horizon strategy; alternative energy; energy storage; machine learning; optimization; price dynamics; smart grid; wind power; Machine learning","D.

To address the limitations, a knowledge-network-embedded DRL method is proposed, which combines the fast-searching capability of genetic algorithm (GA) with the environment-aware decision-making capability of DRL, with the aim of developing a highly efficient energy management strategy in improving user comfort and reducing operating costs. GA is used to solve the IES optimization model for obtaining a solution set that serves as domain knowledge, and a knowledge network is constructed using deep learning (DL). Then, DRL uses this network as an actor network to explore the optimal strategy. The use of GA helps the DRL to enhance training efficiency and find an optimal strategy.

For middle- to large-sized hydropower units, its irregular vibration zone (VZ) is a major factor affecting its flexibility, because VZs limits the power output and adjustment range. In the existing studies on hydropower unit commitment and flexibility scheduling, VZs only limits the output of hydropower units, while the impact on the flexibility adjustment ability of units is ignored. The hydropower flexibility in day-ahead scheme is overestimated, which increases the risk of system flexibility shortage causing power curtailment and load loss. In this study, a novel day-ahead scheduling model considering the flexibility limited by the VZs and the probability of flexibility shortage is constructed for the day-ahead generation scheme of hydropower-VRE hybrid generation system (HVHGS) to optimize the target load, VRE output and hydropower unit commitments. The impaction of the VZs on hydropower flexibility is firstly modeled by chance constraints and stochastic programming method. Moreover, a data-driven model based on machine learning and an efficient solving approach based on successive linear programming is carry out to describe the uncertainty of VRE output more realistically and ensure the timeliness of optimization scheme, respectively. The proposed model is applied to a real hydropower station in the Hongshui River Basin in China. In 16 representative scenarios, the proposed model can complete the optimization in an acceptable time, with a maximum of 444.57 s. Compared with the traditional interval optimization model, the proposed model effectively improves the flexibility supply capacity of hydropower in the day-ahead scheme. The maximum reduction value of flexibility shortage probability and expectation reach 98.77% and 442.66 MW, respectively. In particular, the flexibility of the model is most obvious under heavy load demand in flood season, and it is almost not at the cost of daily target load adjustment, which provides practical reference for decision makers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Day-ahead scheduling; Hydropower flexibility; Hydropower vibration zones; Renewable energy hybrid generation systems; Scenario generation; Stochastic programming","China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Hongshui River; Decision making; Hybrid systems; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Linear programming; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Day-ahead; Day-ahead scheduling; Hybrid generation system; Hydropower flexibility; Hydropower units; Hydropower vibration zone; Renewable energies; Renewable energy hybrid generation system; Scenarios generation; Variable renewable energies; alternative energy; machine learning; optimization; power generation; scenario analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; stochasticity; Stochastic programming","D.

Chemical energy carriers are likely to play an essential role in future energy systems, where harvesting and utilization of renewable energy occur not necessarily at the same time or place, hence long-time storage and long-range transport of energy are needed. For this, hydrogen-based chemical energy carriers, such as hydrogen and ammonia, will play a very important role in future energy systems. Furthermore, there is significant promise in carbon-based fuels made from upgrading CO2, lignocellulosic biomass, or a combination of both with renewable electricity-derived hydrogen, yielding electro-fuels, biofuels, and bio-hybrid fuels, respectively. The utilization of these future fuels by combustion-based energy conversion has many advantages, e.g., versatile use for heat and power, robust and flexible technologies, and suitability for a continuous energy transition. However, there are also challenges, which need to be addressed and will be discussed in the present paper. Hydrogen-based fuels are well known to possess combustion properties very different from conventional fuels, such as the occurrence of intrinsic flame instabilities for lean premixed flames, which can lead to a several-fold increase of the consumption speeds for a wide range of conditions. Bio-hybrid fuels show enormous molecular diversity allowing for a task-specific optimization of the fuel structure, which however, call for a fuel-design methodology based on quantitative fuel-structure/property relationships. The energy transition requires substantial adjustments of combustion devices and processes for future fuels to ensure clean, safe, efficient, and fuel-flexible combustion, which will have to be accomplished relatively quickly. Computational methods are a vital element of modern design and optimization with particular importance when rapid developments are required or complex objectives are pursued. Yet, because of the highly non-linear nature and the complexities associated with combustion and the resulting difficulties in the development of predictive models, this also requires a transition to new methods. Recently, machine-learning-based methods have been embraced as an important new pillar in modeling, especially for situations where physics-based approaches have reached maturity, but are still limited in accuracy and applicability. Some interesting examples of machine-learning approaches in combustion model development will be discussed. © 2024 The Author(s)","Ammonia; Artificial neural networks; Bio-hybrid fuels; Carbon-based fuels; Data-driven methods; Energy transition; Future fuels; Hydrogen; Machine learning","Ammonia; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Digital storage; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Neural networks; Bio-hybrid fuel; Bio-hybrids; Carbon-based fuels; Chemical energy; Data-driven methods; Energy carriers; Energy transitions; Future fuel; Hybrid fuels; Machine-learning; Machine learning","","","Elsevier Ltd","15407489","","SYMCA","","English","Proc.

This research investigates the performance of distinct Machine Learning (ML) techniques—namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and CNN performance tuning using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)—for Battery Health Analysis (BHA). The dataset comprises various parameters related to battery health, with Remaining Useful Time (RUL) as the target variable. The proposed work is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) scores. Initially, the basic LR Model is employed for BHA, followed by the CNN Model to capture complex data patterns. Subsequently, the CNN Model's performance is optimized using the PSO algorithm, aiming for improved performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the CNN Model significantly outperforms the LR approach in terms of accuracy, lower RMSE and MAE, and higher R2 scores. The conventional CNN model significantly outperformed the LR approach, resulting a lower RMSE of 20.11, MAE of 15.26, and higher R2 score of 0.996; whereas, the PSO-Optimized-CNN further enhanced the performance metrics with RMSE of 14.97, MAE of 8.03 and R2 score of 0.998. Henceforth, the PSO-optimized CNN Model exhibits further improved performance metrics compared to the standalone CNN Model.

The study's focus is to determine suitable sizes for photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and battery electrical energy systems by evaluating energy, economic, and environmental criteria. To achieve this, we develop a data-driven model that incorporates Homer Pro and an in-house tool developed in Python programming language that integrates a machine learning algorithm, life cycle cost (LCC), life cycle assessment (LCA) calculations of the REC model. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model is established to minimize the LCC and LCA parameters while maximizing green energy use. Moreover, a multi-criteria decision-making approach based on Weighted Sum Model (WSM) is proposed to help the stakeholders to see beyond the selection criteria based on LCC and LCA to choose the most appropriate scenario optimal solution for the desired energy community and interpret the effect of various economic parameters on the sustainable performance of REC. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for the optimal design of REC for a residential community in Tarragona, Spain, consisting of 100 buildings. The results revealed a substantial improvement in economic and environmental benefits for designing REC, the optimal minimum cost solution with a levelized cost of energy (LCOE = 0.044 $/kWh) and a payback period of 7.1 years with an LCOE reduction of 85.04% compared to the base case. The minimum impact with an LCOE = 0.220 $/kWh and a payback period of 12.5 years with a reduction in environmental impact of 54.59% compared to the base case. Overall, the developed data-driven provides policy decision-making with an evaluation of REC in the residential sector. © 2024 The Authors","Energy community; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Machine learning; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-objective optimization; Optimization","Spain; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Housing; Investments; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Energy; Energy community; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Machine-learning; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-objectives optimization; Multicriteria decision-making; Multicriterion decision makings; Optimisations; alternative energy; environmental impact; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; multicriteria analysis; parameter estimation; spatiotemporal analysis; Life cycle","D.

It plays a vital role in ensuring safe and stable operation of power grid, diminishing fuel consumption, and minimizing environmental impacts. This research presents a machine learning prediction model that integrates intelligent optimization algorithms and data decomposition techniques for short-term wind power output forecasting. The initial phase of this research develops a prediction model utilizing variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory networks. To mitigate the randomness and uncertainty of wind energy, and improve prediction accuracy, the butterfly optimization algorithm is introduced to optimize the parameters of variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory networks.

The escalating demand for power has created an energy scarcity, necessitating innovative solutions to balance supply and consumption. In this context, the transition from traditional electric grids to smart grids (SG) is gaining prominence. To harness the potential of smart urban homes, particularly in the context of renewable energy, solar panels on rooftops have become indispensable. Smart grid technologies enable users to engage in demand response strategies, offering incentives and financial benefits for flexible device usage. This study introduces a novel optimization algorithm, the Polar Bear Optimization Algorithm (PBOA), designed to schedule domestic device usage patterns efficiently. To evaluate the effectiveness of PBOA, this paper conducts comparative analyses with other optimization algorithms such as Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSOA). Energy cost metrics, including Critical Peak Price (CPP) and Real-Time Price (RTP), are employed to assess cost reduction strategies. The primary focus of this study is to minimize energy costs and reduce the Peak to Average Ratio (PAR), thereby promoting economic growth and environmental sustainability in smart urban homes. It should be noted that neural network (NN) machine learning technique has been used for forecasting the weather and renewable energies output power. © 2024","Environmental sustainability; Smart appliances; Smart homes; Urban energy transition","Automation; Developing countries; Environmental management; Intelligent buildings; Learning systems; Mammals; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Weather forecasting; Economic growths; Energy cost; Environmental sustainability; Integration of renewable energies; Optimization algorithms; Polar bears; Smart appliances; Smart homes; Urban energy; Urban energy transitions; algorithm; alternative energy; artificial neural network; economic growth; electronic equipment; price dynamics; sustainability; urban area; Cost reduction","M.

Energy transition through electrified transportation is one of the solutions to tackle the issues. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer significant environmental and economic advantages against the conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. EVs are called mobility loads and their connectivity to the utility grid for charging is unpredictable. The large penetration of such unpredictable loads into the utility grid will lead to undesirable impacts on the utility service. This paper highlights the importance of managing and optimizing the charging schedules. The optimization of EV charging has diverse aspects, and the perspectives of EV charging differ among consumers, aggregators, and utility services. Proper planning and management of EV charging is essential to achieve harmony amongst these stakeholders. A comprehensive review on the objectives of electric vehicle charging optimization from various perspectives is presented and discussed in this paper. EV charging optimization techniques including mathematical programming, meta heuristics algorithms and machine learning techniques are explored. The main objectives, constraints, strength, and limitations of different charging optimization techniques are analyzed in detail. A brief discussion on the communication strategies for data exchange in EV charging framework is presented and the need for a communication security constrained EV charging scheduling is also emphasized.

Utilising this energy source does not generate harmful emissions, making it a superior substitute for fossil fuel-based energy. The computational expense associated with simulating and computing intricate hydrodynamic interactions in wave farms restricts optimisation methods to a few thousand evaluations and makes a challenging situation for training in deep neural prediction models. To address this issue, we propose a new solution: a Meta-learner gradient boosting method that employs four multi-layer convolutional dense neural network surrogate models combined with an optimised extreme gradient boosting. In order to train and validate the predictive model, we used four wave farm datasets, including the absorbed power outputs and 2D coordinates of wave energy converters (WECs) located along the southern coast of Australia, Adelaide, Sydney, Perth and Tasmania. Furthermore, the capability of the transfer learning strategy is evaluated. The WECs used in this study are of the fully submerged three-tether converter type, similar to the CETO prototype. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed by comparing it with 15 well-established and effective machine learning (ML) methods. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model is competitive with other ML and deep learning approaches, exhibiting considerable accuracy of 88.8%, 90.0%, 90.3%, and 84.4% in Adelaide, Perth, Sydney and Tasmania and improved robustness in predicting wave farm power output. © 2024 The Author(s)","Deep ensemble learning method; Extreme gradient boosting; Power output prediction; Renewable energy; Transfer learning; Wave energy","Adelaide; Australia; New South Wales; Perth [Western Australia]; South Australia; Sydney [New South Wales]; Tasmania; Western Australia; Deep learning; Energy transfer; Fossil fuels; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Water waves; Wave energy conversion; Deep ensemble learning method; Ensemble learning; Extreme gradient boosting; Gradient boosting; Learning methods; Power output; Power output prediction; Renewable energies; Transfer learning; Wave energy; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; machine learning; numerical model; prediction; wave energy; wind farm; Forecasting","M.

The proposed workflow leverages deep neural network surrogates trained on data obtained from numerical simulations. The use of surrogates allows for a more flexible and faster evaluation of novel designs. The success history-based adaptive differential evolution with linear reduction and the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition were identified as the best-performing algorithms and used to determine the influence of different objectives in the single-objective optimisation and their combined impact on the draft tube design in the multi-objective optimisation. The results for the single-objective algorithm are consistent with those of the multi-objective algorithm when the objectives are considered separately. Multi-objective approach, however, should typically be chosen, especially for computationally inexpensive surrogates. A multi-criteria decision analysis method was used to obtain optimal multi-objective results, showing an improvement of 1.5% and 17% for the pressure recovery factor and drag coefficient, respectively. The difference between the predictions and the numerical results is less than 0.5% for the pressure recovery factor and 3% for the drag coefficient. As the demand for renewable energy continues to increase, the relevance of data-driven optimisation workflows, as discussed in this study, will become increasingly important, especially in the context of global sustainability efforts. © 2024","Draft tube; Hydropower turbine; Machine learning; Multi-objective optimisation; Surrogate modelling","Computational efficiency; Deep neural networks; Drag coefficient; Evolutionary algorithms; Computationally efficient; Draft tubes; Efficient optimisation; Hydropower turbine; Machine-learning; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Single objective; Surrogate modeling; Work-flows; Multiobjective optimization","L.

In addition, the necessity of smooth material and information flow in the supply chain has motivated scholars to invent different mathematical approaches to designing an integrated supply chain. Such an integrated biomass-to-electricity supply chain can guarantee smooth material and information flow in the supply chain. To this end, a data-driven robust optimization approach under disjunctive uncertainties is developed for designing and optimizing an integrated sustainable biomass-to-electricity supply chain network. Instead of assuming uncertain parameters data to be less scattered or almost uniform, an uncertainty set based on data with disjunctive structures is proposed to identify the uncertainty space more accurately and flexibly. Specifically, the data on uncertain parameters are clustered using the K-means technique. Then, the primary uncertainty sets are formed for each cluster. The proposed uncertain parameter space is constructed by incorporating these primary uncertainty sets, which form using support vector clustering. We studied a case in Iran to probe the performance of the proposed approach. The computational results indicate that the proposed framework provides maximum protection against disjunctive uncertainty with minimum robustness price. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass-to-electricity; Data-driven robust optimization; Disjunctive uncertainty; Machine learning; Supply chain design","Iran; Fossil fuels; K-means clustering; Learning algorithms; Optimization; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Uncertainty analysis; Vector spaces; Biomass-to-electricity; Data driven; Data-driven robust optimization; Disjunctive uncertainty; Machine-learning; Material Flow; Robust optimization; Supply-chain designs; Uncertain parameters; Uncertainty; alternative energy; electricity supply; fossil fuel; machine learning; optimization; supply chain management; Biomass","M.

This study proposes a “Forecasting-Optimizing” approach for regional peak load optimization that integrates a machine learning-based power load forecasting and optimization model. First, the Attention-based temporal convolutional network (TCN) model is used to predict the time-point load curve in the next year. Then, considering the peak power cutting ratio, time-point distribution and duration, focusing on newly added photovoltaic (PV) installations, user-side demand response (USDR), and energy storage (ES), we built a regional peak load optimization model with the goal of minimizing the peak cutting cost. Taking Anhui Province as an example, the empirical test is carried out. The results show that at 97 % level, the peak power in Anhui Province in 2023 will be about 3 million kWh, and the optimal combination strategy of peak cutting is that the Newly added PV installed capacity is 970.6 MW, and the demand response scale during the night is 1448.2 MW; at 95 % level, the peak power will reach more than 11 million kWh, and the optimal combination strategy is that the Newly added PV installed capacity is 2793.6 MW, and the demand response scale during the night is 2413.7 MW; at 90 % level, the peak power will reach 70 million kWh, and the optimal combination strategy is that the Newly added PV installed capacity is 6464 MW, the demand response scales are respectively 1021 MW and 2900 MW during day and night, and the energy storage configuration scale is 4.06 million kWh. Furthermore, the cost and efficiency of the optimal combination peak cutting strategies are different among different peak power reduction levels. It is suggested that decision-makers analyze power load characteristics of regional power systems, and consider renewable energy penetration and USDR resources to determine the optimal peak cutting strategy that minimizes the cost. This study can provide a solution for the formulation of regional peak cutting policy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","ES; Long-term load forecasting; PV; Regional peak cutting strategy; USDR","Decision making; Electric energy storage; Electric load forecasting; Electric power plant loads; Optimization; Renewable energy; Combination strategies; Demand response; Installed capacity; Long-term load forecasting; Optimal combination; Peak power; Photovoltaics; Regional peak cutting strategy; Regional power systems; User-side demand response; Electric power distribution","J.

However, optimizing EV charging to align with grid stability and renewable energy availability remains a challenge. To address this challenge, this study introduces a machine learning-based framework to optimize EV charging by considering driver satisfaction - a novel approach quantifying this multidimensional construct through socio-demographic attributes, State of Charge (SoC), proximity to charging stations, and variable charging fees. Driver satisfaction is defined as the extent to which the EV charging experience aligns with drivers' expectations, integrating these key factors to influence decision-making and overall happiness with the charging service. Trained on a dataset from Hungarian EV users, the developed model predicts outcomes with high accuracy (87.9%), leading to an optimization algorithm that maximizes driver satisfaction while minimizing grid power purchase costs. Our results from a simulated smart grid demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an average charging satisfaction score of 98.5% compared to 69.54% from a traditional method. Additionally, the proposed method maintained the SoC of the EV fleet at a stable average around 50%, optimizing energy use and grid stability. By dynamically assigning EVs to charging stations and leveraging photovoltaic sources, our solution not only boosts driver satisfaction but also aids in the sustainable growth of smart grids. This research marks a significant step forward in the smart management of EV charging by introducing a driver-centric optimization model, filling a critical gap in current literature and offering insights into its application in enhancing urban mobility solutions. © 2013 IEEE.","charging satisfaction; driver behavior; Electric vehicle; machine learning; optimization","Advanced driver assistance systems; Artificial intelligence; Automobile drivers; Behavioral research; Charging (batteries); Decision making; Electric vehicles; Learning systems; Smart power grids; Behavioral science; Charging satisfaction; Driver's behavior; Electric vehicle charging; Grid stability; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Predictive models; Energy efficiency","S.

Current research indicates that effectively managing dynamic energy flows, adjusting to changing needs, and protecting against new cyber threats remain significant challenges for the smart grid system. An advanced and comprehensive plan for managing smart grids is therefore required, capable of addressing these delicate and multifaceted problems.

The stochastic and variable charging EVs and also the unpredictability of renewable energy resources (RERs) are incorporated in the suggested layout. A vehicle to grid layout, which has become suitable for the MG cost function, is being used for mitigating adverse impacts of vehicles on MGs. In order to support the use of RERs, this study proposes a new machine learning-enabled probabilistic method utilizing support vector machine and point estimation methods for keeping the system in a stable state taking into account their random behavior.

In the smart grid, demand response aggregator, power customers, and utility operator all strive to increase their individual profits. However, it is extremely challenging to guarantee profits for all of the candidates simultaneously. In this paper, these criteria are employed to execute a problem with multiple objectives by combining the concept of DSM and dynamic economic emission dispatch considering uncertainties of renewable energy sources (RESs). The uncertainties of RESs can bring adverse effects on the grid operator. Thus, Weibull probability distribution function and lognormal probability distribution function are used to model the uncertainties of wind speed and solar irradiation, respectively, in this paper. Further, the multi-objective improved DSM scheme is optimized by Class Topper optimization algorithm. The objective here is to optimally schedule load demand and generation pattern simultaneously to improve load factor, minimize electricity bill and maximize the profits of all candidates of the day-ahead electricity market simultaneously. Error in the load forecasting model may lead to growing operational cost of energy generation. In this paper, a machine learning model using linear regression is used for short-term load forecasting (STLF) to forecast day-ahead load demand. The simulation results show the importance of the improved DSM scheme and the advantage of STLF, which further help to improve the economy and efficiency of the smart grid. © 2023, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.","Demand side management (DSM); Dynamic economic emission dispatch (DEED); Machine learning; Short-term load forecasting (STLF); Smart grid","Demand side management; Distribution functions; Electric load dispatching; Electric power distribution; Electric power plant loads; Electric utilities; Forecasting; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Weibull distribution; Wind speed; Demand side management; Dynamic economic emission dispatch; Economic-emission dispatch; Machine-learning; Management scheme; Renewable energy source; Short term load forecasting; Short-term load forecasting; Smart grid; Uncertainty; Machine learning","D.K.

A machine learning-driven robust model predictive control framework is proposed for sustainable multi-zone buildings using renewable energies. This framework addresses uncertainties of weather forecast in energy management, reduces overall electricity expenses, and ensures thermal comfort for occupants. Sustainable technologies, including solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, and battery energy storage systems are considered. Optimization of the predicted mean vote index, considering factors such as humidity, temperature, and clothing insulation, is achieved to improve thermal comfort. Initial analysis and modeling of temperature, solar radiation, and humidity forecast errors are conducted using density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise and K-means clustering. Machine learning techniques then construct disjunctive data-driven uncertainty sets of forecast errors. Employing a data-driven optimization method, control inputs are produced at each interval to reduce overall electricity expenses while maintaining a comfortable environment for building inhabitants. This study presents a year-long simulation of a sustainable, multi-zone, two-story building in Ithaca, New York, focusing on managing humidity, temperature, and the predicted mean vote index, taking into account dynamic energy pricing. The proposed approach results in 6.9% less electricity cost with a higher stability of the energy system than the data-driven robust control approach without clustering methods. © 2023","Building energy management; Clustering-based uncertainty sets; Decarbonization; Renewable energy systems; Robust model predictive control","Costs; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Errors; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Optimization; Renewable energy; Smart power grids; Thermal comfort; Thermal insulation; Building energy managements; Clustering-based uncertainty set; Clusterings; Decarbonisation; Energy systems; Forecast errors; Renewable energies; Renewable energy system; Robust model predictive control; Uncertainty; alternative energy; control system; energy management; geothermal energy; optimization; solar power; uncertainty analysis; Buildings","F.

Among these, solar stills have emerged as a solution for water desalination. With the advent of expert system technologies, avenues are opened for improving the operational efficiency of solar distillers. This paper presents an innovative approach utilizing correlation analysis, ReliefF for feature selection, and a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm for forecasting the cumulative distillate output of a double slope solar still. The analysis is based on a 6-cases-based dataset, which includes variations in distillate output relative to different operational-environmental conditions. Key features that significantly impact overall performance were identified to manage the solar distiller productivity. The findings reveal that the maximum distillate output was 1610 ML/m2.day due to incorporating reflective materials and phase change materials (PCM) in enhancing distillation rates. The kNN model was evaluated based on its R2, RMSE, and CVRMSE, with the best models achieving scores of 0.995, 0.0033, and 0.1666, respectively.

This strategy employs ML to make accurate probabilistic predictions of biogas performance by leveraging diverse real-life operational and inspection sensor and other measurement data for asset management, decision making, and structural health monitoring (SHM). The paper commences with data analysis and preprocessing of complex irregular datasets to facilitate efficient learning in an artificial neural network. Subsequently, a Bayesian mixture density neural network model incorporating an attention-based mechanism in bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) was developed. This probabilistic approach uses a distribution output layer based on the Gaussian mixture model and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout technique in estimating data and model uncertainties, respectively. Furthermore, systematic hyperparameter optimisation revealed that the optimised model achieved a negative log-likelihood (NLL) of 0.074, significantly outperforming other configurations. It achieved an accuracy approximately 9 times greater than the average model performance (NLL = 0.753) and 22 times greater than the worst performing model (NLL = 1.677). Key factors influencing the model’s accuracy, such as the input window size and the number of hidden units in the BiLSTM layer, were identified, while the number of neurons in the fully connected layer was found to have no significant impact on accuracy. Moreover, model calibration using the expected calibration error was performed to correct the model’s predictive uncertainty. The findings suggest that the inherent data significantly contribute to the overall uncertainty of the model, highlighting the need for more high-quality data to enhance learning. This study lays the groundwork for applying ML in transforming high-value assets into intelligent structures and has broader implications for ML in asset management, SHM applications, and renewable energy sectors. © 2024 by the authors.","anaerobic lagoon; Bayesian neural network; deep learning; hyperparameter optimisation; long short-term memory; machine learning; mixture density; model calibration; Monte Carlo dropout","Anaerobiosis; Bayes Theorem; Biofuels; Calibration; Machine Learning; Monte Carlo Method; Neural Networks, Computer; Sewage; Bayesian networks; Biogas; Brain; Decision making; Lakes; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Monte Carlo methods; Structural health monitoring; Uncertainty analysis; Water treatment; biofuel; Anaerobic Lagoons; Bayesian neural networks; Deep learning; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Log likelihood; Machine-learning; Mixture density; Model calibration; Monte carlo dropout; Performance; anaerobic growth; artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; calibration; machine learning; Monte Carlo method; sewage; Gaussian distribution","B.S.

Extracting time series from sophisticated wind power data and thus improving the prediction accuracy of wind power generation has become the key to short-term forecasting. This paper proposes a Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) prediction model based on Crested Porcupine Optimizer (CPO), Variational Modal Decomposition (VMD) with Improved Dung Beetle Optimization Algorithm (QHDBO). Firstly, by analyzing the correlation between the variables in the wind power data, the CPO algorithm is used to optimize the modal decomposition number and the penalty parameter of the VMD and extract the time-series information of the wind power series, and smooth it to obtain a number of sub-sequences with strong regularity.

Leveraging a merged dataset comprising environmental parameters like ambient and module temperatures, irradiation, and historical yield, our study embarks on a comprehensive evaluation journey.

Indeed, in one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 7), the UN recommends universal access to electricity for all at the lowest cost. Several optimization methods with different strategies have been proposed in the literature as ways to achieve this goal. This paper proposes a microgrid installation and planning model based on a combination of several techniques. The programming language Python 3.10 was used in conjunction with machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning based on K-means clustering and deterministic optimization methods based on mixed linear programming. These methods were complemented by the open-source spatial method for optimal electrification planning: onsset. Four levels of study were carried out. The first level consisted of simulating the model obtained with a cluster, which is considered based on the elbow and k-means clustering method as a case study. The second level involved sizing the microgrid with a capacity of 40 kW and optimizing all the resources available on site. The example of the different resources in the Togo case was considered. At the third level, the work consisted of proposing an optimal connection model for the microgrid based on voltage stability constraints and considering, above all, the capacity limit of the source substation. Finally, the fourth level involved a planning study of electrification strategies based mainly on microgrids according to the study scenario. The results of the first level of study enabled us to obtain an optimal location for the centroid of the cluster under consideration, according to the different load positions of this cluster. Then, the results of the second level of study were used to highlight the optimal resources obtained and proposed by the optimization model formulated based on the various technology costs, such as investment, maintenance, and operating costs, which were based on the technical limits of the various technologies. In these results, solar systems account for 80% of the maximum load considered, compared to 7.5% for wind systems and 12.5% for battery systems. Next, an optimal microgrid connection model was proposed based on the constraints of a voltage stability limit estimated to be 10% of the maximum voltage drop. The results obtained for the third level of study enabled us to present selective results for load nodes in relation to the source station node. Finally, the last results made it possible to plan electrification using different network technologies and systems in the short and long term. The case study of Togo was taken into account. The various results obtained from the different techniques provide the necessary leads for a feasibility study for optimal electrification of off-grid areas using microgrid systems. © 2024 by the authors.","k-means clustering; microgrids; mixed integer linear programming; onsset; optimization","Electric loads; Electric substations; Electric utilities; Integer programming; Investments; Learning systems; Open source software; Operating costs; Case-studies; Installation models; Integer Linear Programming; K-means++ clustering; Microgrid; Mixed integer linear; Mixed integer linear programming; Off-grids; Onsset; Optimisations; K-means clustering","M.

The microgrid with the characteristics of development and extension can fully promote the large-scale access of such distributed power sources with strong randomness, thus achieving rapid development and construction. At the same time, the development of electric vehicles (EV) is a trend to ensure low-carbon energy. China also regards the development of electric vehicles as a strategic emerging industry. The development of microgrids has also prompted electric vehicles to be widely used in power grid shaving peaks and valleys, and curb power fluctuations. However, when large-scale electric vehicles are connected to the microgrid at the same time, it may also lead to the degradation of the power quality of the islanded microgrid, and even the instability of the entire microgrid. To this end, a multi-microgrid power generation control strategy with electric vehicles based on evolvable model predictive control (MPC) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, based on the multi-microgrid interconnection structure of controller interaction, considering the coupling relationship between generator terminal voltage regulation and system frequency control, a power generation control model with multiple microgrids with electric vehicles is established. Secondly, an adaptive algorithm of controller parameters based on MA-DDPG is designed: the frequency controller takes the real-time frequency offset and EV station output power boundary as the state set, and the adjustable parameter matrix Qx of the MPC controller as the action set, and the frequency deviation is used as the reward function index, and the voltage controller takes the real-time voltage as the state set, the proportional-integral coefficient of the PI controller as the action set, and the voltage offset as the reward function index; so as to realize the adaptive adjustment of the weight parameters of the MPC and the PI controller. Meanwhile, under the architecture of ""centralized training and distributed execution"", the intelligent agent group can realize the cooperative control between the sub-microgrids according to the real-time operating status information. The simulation results show that, the automatic voltage regulation loop increases the active power disturbance, which puts forward higher requirements for the load frequency controller. Under the load disturbance and wind power disturbance, the microgrid frequency control effect under the learning-based MPC controller is significantly better than that of the traditional controller. When various extreme faults occur in the system, the proposed controller can still control the frequency fluctuation of the microgrid within 0.01 Hz through coordinated control and parameter self-adaptation, the control excellence rate can still reach 100%, and the recovery time is still less than 1 s, the robustness of the multi-microgrid performance is significantly enhanced, and the performance is better than the traditional MPC controller in all aspects. In addition, when the machine learning controller fails, the proposed two-layer controller structure can still ensure that the frequency fluctuation of the microgrid is controlled within 0.01 Hz, and the control excellence rate can reach 100%, which is significantly better than the DDPG controller. The following conclusions can be drawn from the simulation analysis: (1) Compared with PID and fuzzy control, the evolvable MPC controller can transform the frequency control process into solving an optimization problem, and thus well adapt to the stochastic scene in the multi-microgrid system. (2) Compared with the traditional MPC, the DDPG agent can adjust the MPC and PI control parameters according to the real-time operating environment state, so as to better adapt to the complex working conditions where the system parameters and structure change with time. (3) Compared with the DDPG controller, the proposed double-layer protection structure has stronger security and stability. When the machine learning agent fails and cannot output actions normally, the MPC controller can use the preset parameters to complete the frequency control process until the machine learning controller returns to normal. © 2024 China Machine Press.

Thermal power units need to adjust from the current load to the given load within a given time period, which provides space for operational improvement. In this paper, we propose an operating improvement method for the thermal power unit based on real-time monitoring data by observation dividing, feature construction and selection, clustering, and machine learning. The unit operation data is categorized into three feature subsets based on domain knowledge, which is used to distinguish different functions of historical data. Subsequently, the optimal feature subset and observations are selected for building regression models, including linear regression (LR), ensemble tree regression (ETR), neural network regression (NNR), and support vector regression (SVR). R-squared (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) are adopted to test the performance of the proposed regression model on the real-time monitoring data of a thermal unit, which has 80,000 observations of 36 different variables. Compared with benchmark methods, the proposed method has lower regression error in the numerical experiment. Thus, we can thereby improve the efficiency of operational management based on the built learning model. Furthermore, in response to peak shaving requirements, the proposed method in this article considers operational optimization over time periods containing multiple time points compared to the traditional operational optimization perspective. With the continuous arrival of monitoring data, the above method can be updated in a timely manner based on the new database to address model adjustments caused by unit aging and other factors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering; Data mining; Feature construction; Feature selection; Operating improvement; Thermal power unit","Domain Knowledge; Errors; Feature extraction; Fossil fuel power plants; Learning systems; Mean square error; Numerical methods; Regression analysis; Clusterings; Feature construction; Feature subset; Features selection; Improvement methods; Operating improvement; Peak-shaving; Real time monitoring; Thermal power units; Time-periods; alternative energy; data mining; monitoring system; power generation; regression analysis; thermal power; vector; Data mining","L.

Simultaneously, the load tracking speed is no longer the only significant task in the flexible operation of USC unit, the operational economy is more and more important. To this end, a hierarchical reinforcement learning GPC control scheme with a better economy is proposed and apply to USC unit. Firstly, the model mismatch problem in control process is taken into account, and an integral mode is added into the GPC to eliminate the steady state error during the load regulation. Secondly, the hierarchical reinforcement learning GPC scheme integrated the GPC and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms is presented. The complex flexibility demand problem is decomposed into rapid load regulation and economic operation and then respectively solved in the GPC-based upper layer and reinforcement learning agent-based lower layer. Thirdly, under the flexibility demand, a multi-criteria optimization function including the load tracking cost, main steam throttling loss and coal consumption rate of unit is constructed. Then, via the accurate trajectory tracking by GPC and on-line control sequence optimization by reinforcement learning agent, the operational flexibility and economy of USC unit are simultaneously improved within safe boundaries. Finally, to verify the availability of the proposed hierarchical reinforcement learning GPC strategy, large-scale load variations and disturbance rejection ability tests cover the 30%–100 % rated load of a 1000 MW USC unit are carried out, and the load regulation performance is compared to other strategies.

However, due to the intermittent, non-stationary and random nature of solar energy, current methods cannot effectively capture the dynamic change patterns of PV data, resulting in a forecasting accuracy that cannot satisfy the requirement for stable operation of smart grids. To address this issue, in this paper, a new solar PV power forecasting system is proposed based on a new adaptive mode decomposition method that combines machine learning models. First an adaptive mode decomposition method is proposed for adaptively eliminating high-frequency information of PV data, mitigating the impact of high noise on the forecasting performance. Then the powerful mapping ability of machine learning model is utilized to construct a solar PV power generation combination forecasting system. The system adopts a multi-objective optimization strategy to determine the optimal weights of the combination model, which reduces the volatility of the forecasting results and enhances the stability of the forecasting system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves the best overall performance with online manner on 10 state-of-the-art baselines.

Despite recent advancements in data-driven Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for BES optimization, significant challenges still exist, such as the time-consuming and data-intensive nature of training DRL controllers and the complexity of environment dynamics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Consequently, these obstacles impede the synchronization and coordination of multiple agent control, leading to slow DRL convergence performance. To address these issues. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize hybrid building energy systems. We introduce an integrated system combining a multi-stage Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on-policy framework with Imitation Learning (IL), interacting with the model environment. To improve scalability and robustness of Multi-agent Systems (MAS), this approach is designed to enhance training efficiency with centralized training and decentralized execution. Simulation results of case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) model in optimizing the operations of hybrid building energy systems in terms of indoor thermal comfort and energy efficiency. Results show the proposed framework significantly improve performance in achieving convergence in just 50 episodes for dynamic decision-making. The scalability and robustness of the proposed model have been validated across various scenarios. Compared with the baseline during cold and warm weeks, the proposed control approach achieved improvements of 34.86% and 46.10% in energy self-sufficiency ratio, respectively. Additionally, the developed MADRL effectively improved solar photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption and reduced household energy costs. Notably, it increased the average indoor temperature closer to the desired set-point by 1.33 °C, and improved the self-consumption ratio by 15.78% in the colder week and 18.47% in the warmer week, compared to baseline measurements. These findings highlight the advantages of the multi-stage PPO on-policy framework, enabling faster learning and reduced training time, resulting in cost-effective solutions and enhanced solar PV self-consumption. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Energy cost; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-stage; Schedule optimization; Thermal comfort","Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decision making; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Fertilizers; Learning systems; Multi agent systems; Scalability; Solar power generation; Thermal comfort; Building energy systems; Energy cost; Hybrid buildings; Multi agent; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-stages; Policy framework; Policy optimization; Reinforcement learnings; Schedule optimizations; cost analysis; decision making; energy efficiency; energy management; household energy; machine learning; optimization; policy approach; residential energy; Reinforcement learning","Y.

In this, the energy management system is crucial for the effective storage of power and regulation of the energy flow system. As a result, Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) has increased interest due to their superior capabilities in system performance and battery capacity when compared to solo energy sources. Additionally, the primary problem interaction applications, including such battery electric vehicles, are the energy storage system. Multiple energy storage technologies, including battery packs, flywheels, super-capacitors and fuel cells, are combined into a HESS due to their complementing properties. The goal of this setup is to make renewable energy sources more reliable by storing power generated from intermittent sources or by providing backup energy generation from traditional energy sources. A HESS could be utilized as an alternate energy storage system to help them make up for their lack of power density. HESS needs a smart Energy Management System (EMS) to function properly since it combines the dynamic characteristics of a battery and a SuperCapacitor (SC). The motive of the study is to suggest an actual power management control system to accomplish these objectives. The plan is built using a wavelet transform, deep learning mechanism, and fuzzy logic together. A useful tool for separating the various frequency elements of a load's power requirements to reflect the properties of a battery or supercapacitor is the wavelet transform. It is challenging to immediately apply it in a system, though. Because of this, the traditional optimization-model-based facility energy management system encounters substantial difficulties with online forecast and calculation. To solve this problem, the paper proposes a ML technique dependent on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The suggested control system structure allows for the separation of the offline and online stages of the LSTM technique. The LSTM is being used to map states (inputs) to decisions (outputs) based on system training during the offline stage. As a result, the supercapacitor receives an online calculation and distribution of the high-frequency power requirement. The SOC of the supercapacitor is kept within the appropriate range via fuzzy logic control. To evaluate the efficacy of the suggested energy management control technique, a 70 V battery with 92 V supercapacitor hybrid energy storage devices for hardware platforms have been created. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Energy management system; Fuzzy logic controller; HESS; Hybrid energy storage system; Long-short term memory; Super capacitor","Battery Pack; Brain; Buses; Computer circuits; Controllers; Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Electric power distribution; Energy management; Environmental technology; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; Fuzzy logic; Hybrid vehicles; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Renewable energy; Standby power systems; Supercapacitor; Wavelet transforms; Energy source; Fuzzy logic controllers; Hybrid energy storage systems; Offline; Power; Power requirement; Property; Storage systems; Super-capacitor; Energy management systems","G.

Hence, this article introduces a new BIPV/T system to optimally minimize the energy consumption of a household residential building. The meticulous design of the proposed BIPV/T system is accomplished through MATLAB/Simulink® dynamic modeling. Performance analysis for the BIPV/T system is performed under different seasonal conditions with in-depth techno-economic analyses to estimate the expected enhancement in the thermal, electrical, and economic performance of the system. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the impact of various factors on the energetic and economic performances of the proposed BIPV/T system. More so, the two-layer feed-forward back-propagation artificial neural network modeling is developed to accurately predict the hourly solar radiation and ambient temperature for the BIPV/T. Additionally, a multi-objective optimization using the NSGA-II method is also conducted for the minimization of the total BIPV/T plant area and maximization of the total efficiency and net thermal power of the system as well as to estimate the optimized operating conditions for input variables across different seasons within the provided ranges. The sensitivity analysis revealed that higher solar flux levels lead to increased electric output power of the BIPV/T plant, but total efficiency decreases due to higher thermal losses. Moreover, the proposed NSGA-II shows a feasible method to attain a maximum net thermal power and optimal total efficiency of 5320 W and 63% with a minimal total plant area of 32.89 m2 that attained a very low deviation index from the ideal solution. The levelised cost of electricity is obtained as 0.10 $/kWh under the optimal conditions. Thus, these findings offer valuable insights into the potential of BIPV/T systems as a sustainable and efficient energy solution for residential applications. © 2024","Artificial intelligence; Building integrated photovoltaic thermal system; Cost effective technology; Multi-objective performance optimization; Sensitivity analysis","Backpropagation; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Housing; Multilayer neural networks; Multiobjective optimization; Building integrated photovoltaic; Building integrated photovoltaic thermal system; Cost-effective technology; Economic performance; Multi-objective performance optimizations; NSGA-II; Photovoltaic/thermal systems; Residential building; Thermal plants; Total efficiency; Sensitivity analysis","M.E.

Forecasting individual bids in spot electricity markets is a promising new method for achieving so, but it has not been fully studied due to the difficulty of forecasting a bid function. The idealization of existing optimization-based models decreases their practical effects in real markets. Thus, we propose a scalable forecasting framework that incorporates several customized state-of-art machine learning methods according to the characteristics of the bidding data. First, several low-rank approximation algorithms are customized to encode the high-dimensional bidding curves into low-dimensional feature spaces and reconstruct them from the predicted feature space. Second, a transformer-based multidimensional time series prediction algorithm is proposed to predict the bidding feature based on both related factors and historical bidding records. To appropriately evaluate the performances of the forecasting methods, we introduce a dynamic criterion based on the economic implications of bids. The comprehensive framework is tested based on actual market data from the Australian national electricity market, and in the empirical example, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework are demonstrated. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Data-driven analysis; Electricity market; Individual bids forecasting; Machine learning","Approximation algorithms; Approximation theory; Electric industry; Machine learning; Power markets; Uncertainty analysis; Data-driven analysis; Feature space; Individual bid forecasting; Learning frameworks; Machine-learning; Penetration rates; Renewable energies; Spot electricity market; Uncertainty; World energies; algorithm; complexity; electricity; energy market; forecasting method; machine learning; prediction; time series analysis; Forecasting","Q.

This paper presents a novel approach to address these challenges through an optimized virtual machine (VM) migration strategy that employs a game-theoretic approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) (PSO-GTA). The proposed approach leverages the collaborative and competitive dynamics of Game Theory to minimize energy consumption while using renewable energy. In this context, the game is represented by the swarm, where each player, embodied by particles, carries both competitive and cooperative elements essential to shape the collective behavior of the swarm. PSO is integrated to refine migration decisions, improving global convergence and optimizing the allocation of VMs to hosts. Through extensive simulations and performance evaluations, the proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and energy efficiency, promoting sustainability in cloud computing environments. This research contributes to the development of environmentally friendly cloud computing systems, thus ensuring the delivery of energy-efficient cloud computing. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms fuzzy and genetic methods in terms of renewable energy usage. The PSO-GTA algorithm consistently outperforms Q-Learning, Pittsburgh and KASIA across three simulation scenarios with varying cloudlet dynamics, showcasing its efficiency and adaptability, and yielding improvements ranging from 0.68% to 5.32% over baseline results in nine simulations. © 2024 The Author(s)","Cloud computing; Follow the renewable; Game theory; Scheduling; Virtual machine migration","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Computer games; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Network security; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sustainable development; Virtual machine; Cloud data centers; Cloud-computing; Energy sustainability; Energy-consumption; Follow the renewable; Particle swarm; Renewable energies; Scheduling; Swarm optimization; Virtual machine migrations; energy efficiency; fuzzy mathematics; game theory; machine learning; resource allocation; simulation; sustainability; Game theory","F.J.

Performance of such systems can be enhanced using a cascade of multiple phase change materials but efficiency benefits currently rely on precise optimization of design parameters. Therefore, there is motivation to develop storage technologies which provide greater flexibility for applications with dynamic operating conditions. In this study, a novel system is proposed called a multi-temperature, multi-module ensemble which consists of multiple phase change materials combined in series and parallel configurations. The system is optimized and controlled by an artificial neural network trained using a multi-objective optimization scheme. The performance for the novel system is compared to two baseline systems: a single phase change material system and a cascaded system. Across a wide range of fixed operating conditions, the results show that the ensemble reduces the rate of exergy destruction by 60% compared to the single module system and achieves a 10 °C improvement in performance for matching target outlet temperature compared to the cascaded system. Over a dynamically changing load profile, the results show that the multi-temperature, multi-module ensemble with artificial neural network controller is the preferable design as it achieves the excellent exergy efficiency of a cascaded system while maintaining the flexibility needed to respond to dynamically changing operating conditions. Furthermore, this novel approach widens the potential applications of latent thermal energy storage by providing a means to standardize manufacturing to drive down system cost and allowing the system to adapt to unforeseen design parameters. © 2023 The Authors","Artificial neural network; Cascaded phase change material; Latent thermal energy storage; Machine learning","Adaptive control systems; Economics; Exergy; Heat storage; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Phase change materials; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; Adaptive machine learning; Cascaded phase change material; Cascaded system; Design parameters; Latent thermal energy storages; Machine-learning; Multimodule; Operating condition; Performance; Thermal storage; Machine learning","A.Y.

The main motivation is a consequent day-to-day verification of algorithmically scheduled power consumption tasks in the proposed two-stage optimisation according to the system resources and user needs. Statistical artificial intelligence (AI) is employed, as local atmospheric turbulences with terrain obstacles and unexpected user activity result in various operational states in real microsystems.

The DfL models were compared with recent deep and machine learning techniques. Prediction models were formed after an initial detection of adequate daily training intervals.

Existing inertia prediction methods rarely use machine learning to predict the equivalent inertia of the power system, and there is also little consideration of the virtual inertia of the renewable energy units; some of the prediction methods rely on massive volumes of system data and suffer from issues such as data redundancy and complex pre-processing procedures. A method for predicting the equivalent inertia for power systems based on particle swarm optimization support vector machines (PSO-SVM) is proposed for this purpose. The method initially creates a database of system-equivalent inertia, which regards the power change and system frequency rate of change as feature inputs and the system-equivalent inertia as an output. Then, the optimal prediction model is matched using the feature difference matrix, and the PSO-SVM prediction method is utilized to predict the power system's equivalent inertia. The method proposed in this paper is validated by an improved three-machine nine-node power system, and the prediction accuracy is better than that of GA-BP neural network and SVM algorithms, and then the applicability in complex scenarios is validated by a ten-machine, thirty-nine-node power system as well as a site-specific power system under real-time wind speeds. The PSO-SVM prediction method reduces the maximum error by 23.64% compared to the GA-BP neural network and 68.27% compared to the SVM algorithm and the results show that the method proposed in this paper can more accurately predict inertial changes and inertial information of the system when a loading accident occurs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Equivalent inertia; Feature difference matrix; Inertia prediction; Particle swarm optimization support vector machines; Renewable energy units","Prediction models; Renewable energy; Difference matrix; Energy units; Equivalent inertia; Feature difference matrix; Feature differences; Inertia prediction; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization support vector machine; Renewable energies; Renewable energy unit; Support vectors machine; Swarm optimization; Support vector machines","Q.

Predictive models are needed for flexible and cost-effective operation of energy production and usage, e.g., using peak shaving or load shifting to compensate for heat losses in the pipeline. This helps to avoid exceedance of power plant capacity. The purpose of this study is to automate the process of building machine learning (ML) models to solve a short-term power demand prediction problem. The dataset contains a district heating network’s measured hourly power consumption and ambient temperature for 415 days. In this paper, we propose a hybrid evolutionary-based algorithm, named GA-SHADE, for the simultaneous optimization of ML models and feature selection. The GA-SHADE algorithm is a hybrid algorithm consisting of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and success-history-based parameter adaptation for differential evolution (SHADE). The results of the numerical experiments show that the proposed GA-SHADE algorithm allows the identification of simplified ML models with good prediction performance in terms of the optimized feature subset and model hyperparameters. The main contributions of the study are (1) using the proposed GA-SHADE, ML models with varying numbers of features and performance are obtained. (2) The proposed GA-SHADE algorithm self-adapts during operation and has only one control parameter. There is no fine-tuning required before execution. (3) Due to the evolutionary nature of the algorithm, it is not sensitive to the number of features and hyperparameters to be optimized in ML models. In conclusion, this study confirms that each optimized ML model uses a unique set and number of features. Out of the six ML models considered, SVR and NN are better candidates and have demonstrated the best performance across several metrics. All numerical experiments were compared against the measurements and proven by the standard statistical tests. © 2024 by the authors.","evolutionary computations; feature selection; machine learning; power consumption forecasting","Cost effectiveness; District heating; Electric power distribution; Electric power utilization; Feature extraction; Heating equipment; Parameter estimation; Weather forecasting; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; District heating networks; Energy productions; Features selection; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Numerical experiments; Parameter adaptation; Power consumption forecasting; Genetic algorithms","A.

Machine learning methods hold significant potential to reduce the computing time for OPF problems by learning a mapping from varying input loads to decisions, thus bypassing the need for an optimization solver during inference. However, current machine learning methods for OPF lack interpretability and may produce infeasible decisions, which impedes their adoption by industry stakeholders. To this end, we propose a novel approach for interpretable learning of OPF solutions with feasibility guarantees. Specifically, we develop prescriptive decision trees that learn a piecewise affine mapping from input data to the solutions of a constrained optimization problem, using robust optimization to ensure that decisions are feasible. One important contribution of our work is the development of a tree-based learning method that utilizes non-orthogonal splits informed by domain knowledge, including network congestion and the merit order curve. By incorporating this information, we enhance both the interpretability and performance of the model. We further present a surrogate learning algorithm to handle large-scale problems. The proposed approach is evaluated on several test networks, up to 300 buses, under different types of uncertainty and operating conditions, and is compared to neural network-based models, which do not guarantee feasibility. Notably, our results demonstrate that interpretable, shallow prescriptive trees perform comparably to neural network-based models, which are considered the current state of the art. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce an interpretable machine learning approach for directly learning OPF solutions. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","DC optimal power flow; decision trees; interpretable machine learning; prescriptive analytics; robust optimization","Constrained optimization; Electric load flow; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mapping; Neural networks; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Uncertainty analysis; DC optimal power flow; Interpretable machine learning; Load flow; Load modeling; Machine-learning; Optimal power flows; Optimisations; Prescriptive analytic; Robust optimization; Uncertainty; Decision trees","A.

To enhance the application potential of phase-change thermal storage units based on micro heat pipe arrays, theoretical analysis is applied to optimize the operating parameters and the fin structure, addressing the research gap caused by insufficient theoretical analysis. Therefore, an accurate thermal resistance network model is developed, and machine learning algorithms are employed for the multi-objective optimization of the fin structure. The optimal heights, widths, and thicknesses in two directions of the fins are 42.2, 3.7, 0.3, and 0.8 mm, respectively, resulting in a 15.8 % increase in charging power compared to the initial structure without increasing metal consumption. Additionally, it is recommended that the design flow rate be increased by 26 kg/h for each additional thermal storage unit connected in series.

The proficient administration of these batteries is imperative in order to guarantee maximum efficiency, prolong their longevity, and uphold safety measures. This study presents a novel methodology for enhancing battery management systems (BMS) through the integration of cloud-based solutions, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning approaches. In this study, we present a conceptual framework that utilises cloud computing to augment the practical functionalities of battery management systems (BMS) specifically in the context of lithium-ion batteries. The incorporation of cloud computing facilitates the implementation of scalable data storage, remote monitoring, and processing resources, hence enabling the execution of real-time analysis and decision-making processes. By leveraging the capabilities of machine learning and artificial intelligence, our methodology focuses on addressing crucial battery metrics, including the state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH). Through the ongoing collection and analysis of data obtained from battery systems that are deployed in real-world settings, the framework iteratively improves its predictive models, hence facilitating precise assessment of battery states. Ensuring safety is a crucial element in the management of batteries. The solution we propose utilises anomaly detection algorithms driven by artificial intelligence to detect potential safety issues, facilitating prompt responses and mitigating dangerous circumstances. In order to showcase the efficacy of our methodology, we offer practical implementations in several industries, encompassing the integration of renewable energy, use of electric vehicles, and optimisation of industrial processes. Through the utilisation of cloud-based machine learning techniques, we are able to enhance the efficiency of energy storage and consumption, while simultaneously enhancing the dependability and security of battery systems.

Therefore, intelligent condition monitoring techniques are crucially important for early gear and bearing fault recognition and detection to avoid any industrial failure due to machine breakdowns. In this paper, an intelligent algorithm for gear and bearing fault diagnosis is suggested based on several approaches mainly: robust empirical mode decomposition (REMD), time domain features are used for the feature extraction step, while equilibrium optimizer (EO) in the feature selection. For feature classification, random forest (RF), ensemble tree (ET) and nearest neighbors (KNN) are chosen as classifiers. REMD is used to alleviate the mode mixing problem by monitoring the sifting process and selecting the optimal iteration number. EO is a recent optimization approach based on the laws of physical theory in nature. EO reduces the high-dimensional data problem, by filtering redundant features, and increasing model generalization efficiency by avoiding the over-fitting curse. The proposed approach is applied to real-time vibration signals from a healthy gearbox and four different faulty gear and bearing conditions. According to our approach, data signals are decomposed by REMD to several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Thereafter, time-domain features are computed for each IMF to construct the feature matrix for every gear and bearing health status. After that, EO is applied to every matrix in the feature selection step. Finally, RF, ET and KNN are used to calculate classification accuracy and give the confusion matrix. Compared to several feature selection techniques, experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed approach in detecting, identifying, and classifying all gear and bearing defects even under different operating modes. © Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited 2023.","Fault diagnosis; Feature classification; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Gearbox; Vibration signals","","A.

However, the rapid depletion of conventional fossil fuels and growing environmental concerns have prompted the evolution of alternative energy sources. To this end, Microgrid (MG) with Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has emerged as popular means of small-scale localized power grid. However, planning of MG operation poses challenges due to the inherent variability and stochasticity in RES power output and energy demand. On account of this, the present study introduces a Stochastic Energy Management Strategy (SEMS) for a grid-connected MG incorporating Micro-Turbine, Fuel-Cell, RES, Battery Energy Storage, and electrical and heat energy demand. The stochasticity of RES is forecasted through a hybrid prediction model (sARIMA-GRU) and the uncertain demand is estimated via 'Monte Carlo Simulation.' The proposed problem is formulated as a dynamic non-linear stochastic optimization problem. It seeks to minimize the expected value of MG operational cost satisfying the practical constraints. Addressing this, a newly developed ‘Artificial Electric Field Algorithm (AEFA)' is utilized. Several case studies are performed to assess MG operation under varied operating conditions. Moreover, the present study analyses the impact of uncertainty on energy contribution from DER, grid dependency, and MG operation cost. Comparative analysis reveals that sARIMA-GRU outperforms other contemporary prediction models. It is noteworthy that the superior prediction accuracy of sARIMA-GRU leads to lower MG operation costs. Moreover, statistical analysis and convergence confirm the proficiency of applied AEFA over state-of-the-art Grey Wolf Optimization and Firefly Algorithm in solving the proposed problem. © 2024 The Author(s)","Machine learning; Microgrid; Optimization; Renewable energy; Uncertainty","","S.

Because of this, renewable energy sources have come to the forefront, and the research interest in microgrids that rely on distributed generation and storage systems has exploded. Furthermore, many new markets for energy trading, ancillary services, and frequency reserve markets have provided attractive investment opportunities in exchange for balancing the supply and demand of electricity. Artificial intelligence can be utilized to locally optimize energy consumption, trade energy with the main grid, and participate in these markets. Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most promising approaches to achieve this goal because it enables an agent to learn optimal behavior in a microgrid by executing specific actions that maximize the long-term reward signal/function. The study focuses on testing two optimization algorithms: logic-based optimization and reinforcement learning. This paper builds on the existing research framework by combining PPO with machine learning-based load forecasting to produce an optimal solution for an industrial microgrid in Norway under different pricing schemes, including day-ahead pricing and peak pricing. It addresses the peak shaving and price arbitrage challenges by taking the historical data into the algorithm and making the decisions according to the energy consumption pattern, battery characteristics, PV production, and energy price. The RL-based approach is implemented in Python based on real data from the site and in combination with MATLAB-Simulink to validate its results. The application of the RL algorithm achieved an average monthly cost saving of 20% compared with logic-based optimization. These findings contribute to digitalization and decarbonization of energy technology, and support the fundamental goals and policies of the European Green Deal. © 2024 by the authors.","BESS; EMS; optimization algorithm; peak shaving; PPO; price arbitrage","Costs; Decision making; Reinforcement learning; BESS; EMS; Energy; Energy-consumption; Microgrid; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Peak-shaving; Price arbitrage; Reinforcement learnings; Clean energy","L.

This paper introduces a new scheduling method for hybrid power systems (HyPS), focusing on frequency security. It considers the time-varying characteristics related to frequency security requirements and the interdependence of components, such as generation units and the delivery network. Firstly, the optimal objective is to minimize overall operational costs and the pressure on energy delivery, ensuring the reserve capacities for fast frequency regulation remained within the predefined limits. Secondly, the frequency constrained unit commitment (FCUC) problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is integrated to correct the advanced scheduling scheme in real-time. Thirdly, the coordinated scheduling scheme dynamically adjusts to operational events like fluctuations and line failures in the HyPS by employing the reward function of a comprehensive assessment. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the practicality of the novel coordinated scheduling approach for hybrid power systems through simulations in the Grid2Op environment. As a result, the frequency security margin of the HyPS is capable of increasing the daily average level of the frequency security margin by 3% across diverse scenarios, including fluctuations in power demand, renewable energy variations, and power line failures. PE-interfaced renewable energy sources are thereby able to integrate with conventional synchronous units as a hybrid power system to support frequency regulation services. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Coordinated control strategy; Deep reinforcement learning; Fast frequency regulation; Reserve scheduling optimization","Deep learning; Electric power system control; Electric power system security; Markov processes; Wind power; Coordinated control strategy; Deep reinforcement learning; Fast frequency regulation; Frequency regulations; Frequency security; Hybrid power; Reinforcement learnings; Reserve scheduling optimization; Scheduling optimization; alternative energy; control system; machine learning; optimization; power line; simulation; Reinforcement learning","J.

However, the ability to meet energy demands, especially during peak periods, is constrained by various factors including environmental concerns, technological limitations, and economic constraints. Effective energy management strategies are crucial to mitigate these challenges and ensure a sustainable energy future. One promising approach is the implementation of demand response programs. In this context, we explore the potential of Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) leveraging modern Internet of Things (IoT) technology. HEMS systems are at the forefront of research and development in the field of smart grids (SGs), offering capabilities in demand-side management and power availability control. These systems achieve efficient energy usage by optimizing the operation of home appliances (HAs). To further enhance the performance of HEMS, this study introduces a novel metaheuristic known as the Grey Wolf and Crow Search Optimization Algorithm (GWCSOA). This algorithm is employed to determine the optimal scheduling of HAs within the HEMS framework. Additionally, we utilize MATLAB and ThingSpeak modules to implement and test the HEMS design. The proposed HEMS, integrated with GWCSOA, demonstrates remarkable capabilities in reducing daily power costs, minimizing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR), and enhancing consumer satisfaction. The findings of this study indicate that the devised system holds the promise of substantially diminishing both power expenses and microgrid emissions. Through the optimization of Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) operations, this methodology plays a vital role in realizing a sustainable urban energy ecosystem. This aligns seamlessly with the overarching objectives of combating climate change and securing the enduring sustainability of our cities. The proposed HEMS, integrated with GWCSOA, demonstrates remarkable capabilities in reducing daily power costs by an average of 25.98 %, minimizing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) by 30 %, and enhancing consumer satisfaction. The outcomes of this research reveal that the developed system has the potential to significantly reduce both power costs and microgrid emissions.

There is a need for more sustainable and less polluting fuels for internal combustion engines. Biomass offers significant potential as a feed material for gasification to produce gaseous fuel. It is carbon neutral, versatile, and abundant on earth. The present study thus explores a mix of different feedstocks, such as mahua wood and low-grade coal for downdraft gasifiers. The resultant producer gas (PG), after cooling-cleaning will be used as the gaseous fuel to run the diesel engine in dual-fuel mode, while a tiny quantity of linseed biodiesel-diesel blends as B20 (20 % biodiesel + 80 % diesel) will be supplied as injected pilot fuel. The data from experimental work at different engine operation settings was employed to develop a prediction-optimization model using a twin approach of RSM and Grey wolf optimization (GWO). The three control factors for the engine were compression ratio (CR) 17 – 17.5 – 18, equivalence ratio 0.12–0.41, and engine loads in the range of 10–100 % were used to collect data on response variables i.e., brake-thermal efficiency (BTE) and emission data (CO2, NOx, UHC, and CO). A comparative approach of RSM and GWO was utilized for the multi-objective optimization revealing the best results were attained at 17.65 CR, 0.4 ER, 82.55 % engine load in the case of GWO. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers","Alternative fuels; Co-gasification; Dual-fuel engine; Machine learning; Optimization; Renewable energy","Coal gasification; Compression ratio (machinery); Diesel engines; Dual fuel engines; Gas fuel purification; Linear programming; Mixed gas fuels; Waste incineration; Co-gasification; Downdraft gasifier; Dual-fuel engines; Gaseous Fuel; Gray wolves; Low-grade coal; Machine-learning; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Renewable energies; Coal","P.

The investigation focused on three different sizes (30 nm, 50 nm, and 80 nm) of Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) suspended in a water-based nanofluid (NF) with a 1 vol% concentration flow in a circular tube. The nanoparticles (NPs) were characterized using various characterization techniques. The stability and pH of the NF were determined, and its viscosity (VST) and thermal conductivity (TC) were measured at a temperature of 60 °C. Heat transfer experiments were conducted with varying particle sizes and Reynolds number (Re), maintaining a fluid inlet temperature of 60 °C. The results indicated that the NF containing 30 nm particles exhibited higher VST and TC compared to the other samples and the base fluid. The maximum enhancement in Nu for Al2O3 (30 nm) and Al2O3 (80 nm) NFs is 60.7 and 18.5 % greater than that of base fluid, respectively. The maximum and minimum total entropy generation (Sgen,T) value of 0.499 and 0.286 observed for base fluid and Al2O3 NF (30 nm), respectively at low Re. The highest friction factor enhancement for Al2O3 NF (30 nm) exceeded by 9.4 % compared to the base fluid, and the maximum thermal performance factor observed for Al2O3 NF (30 nm) was 1.57. Finally, regression analysis was employed to establish correlations for estimating Nu and friction factor values. Prognostic models were developed using two sophisticated machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR). Both models demonstrated exceptional prediction abilities, achieving over 99 % accuracy rates based on the experimental data. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS","Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; Entropy generation; Evacuated tube; Heat transfer; Nanofluids; Optimization; Renewable energy; Solar energy","Adaptive boosting; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Entropy; Factor analysis; Friction; Heat convection; Machine learning; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Regression analysis; Reynolds number; Specific heat; Thermal conductivity of liquids; Entropy generation; Evacuated tubes; Friction factors; Gradient boosting; Nanofluids; Optimisations; Particles sizes; Renewable energies; Second Law of Thermodynamics; Thermo dynamic analysis; Solar energy","P.

The random nature of the weather causes challenges for the reliability, power quality, and supply–demand balance of such microgrids. Therefore, energy demand forecasts are increasingly crucial for the effective and continuous operation of the power grid. They also aid in achieving the best possible use of resources to push the limits of self-sufficiency. This study examines not only the quality but the so-called value of a forecast from the point of choosing a forecasting approach. Usually, forecasting approaches are ranked using quality metrics, such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) or root mean square error (RMSE). In addition, the value of a forecast is considered in this study by measuring concrete results for a local energy community (LEC), such as the load cover factor, supply cover factor, on-site energy ratio, and cost of electricity. These evaluations are based on a model of an LEC that includes not only the electric components but also a building and a selected heat pump system for space heating and cooling that is fully dynamical. The optimal operation of this exemplary LEC and the integration of demand forecasts for electricity and domestic hot water (DHW) are achieved with model predictive control (MPC). Several relevant studies on management in LEC are available, but almost none of the publications examine demand forecasting strategies and optimal building asset optimisation at the same time. This research provides two major contributions: first, by developing a more comprehensive framework to assess forecasting performance with reference to energy communities; and second, by highlighting the connection between quality and value indicators of forecasts in the context of energy communities. This study's findings show that depending solely on quality metrics when choosing a forecasting approach is insufficient and gives no clear statement about the true value of a forecast. This paper identifies the impact of more accurate forecasts on energy community performance measures and attempts to provide an outlook on theoretically achievable improvements based on significantly better forecasts. Finally, this work highlights several open research issues and prospects. © 2022 The Author(s)","Assessing forecasting models; Building asset optimisation; Energy community; Energy management systems; Forecasting; Machine learning; Model predictive control","Electric energy storage; Electric loads; Energy management; Energy management systems; Forecasting; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Machine learning; Mean square error; Power quality; Predictive control systems; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Assessing forecasting model; Asset optimization; Building asset optimization; Demand forecast; Energy; Energy community; Forecasting models; Local energy; Machine-learning; Model-predictive control; Model predictive control","D.

However, in the research field of IGBT health evaluation, there are still problems that the accuracy is not high enough and the reliability manager of IGBT cannot accurately grasp. In this study, an IGBT health status evaluation model based on improved krill herd optimized extreme learning machine (IKH-ELM) is proposed to accurately evaluate the health status of IGBT, provide guidance for timely replacement of components, thus reducing the failure probability and maintenance cost, and improving the system reliability. Firstly, the power cycle accelerated aging test, short pulse-high amplitude current test and thermal resistance measurement test are carried out to obtain the failure predictor parameters data of IGBT. Then, an IGBT health status classification method based on cloud model is proposed to make the health status assessment results more scientific. In addition, since the random selection of weights and thresholds of ELM affects the performance of the model, the krill herd algorithm is improved to optimize ELM for obtaining better prediction ability. Based on this, a prediction model based on IKH-ELM is established. Finally, the proposed model is proved to be more accurate and effective under the same experimental environment and the same index.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.","extreme learning machine; failure precursory parameters; Health assessment; improved krill herd algorithm","Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine components; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Reliability; Renewable energy resources; Extreme learning machine; Failure precursory parameter; Health assessments; Improved krill herd algorithm; Insulatedgate bipolar transistor (IGBTs); Learning machines; Optimisations; Prediction algorithms; Renewable energy source; Forecasting","L.

The objective of our research is to investigate the enhancement of the conversion process by employing a machine-learning approach. Specifically, we utilize a support vector machine (SVM) to model and evaluate the impact of different operational parameters on the resulting gas mixture. One notable feature of this study involves the incorporation of an adaptive marine predator algorithm (AMPA) into the SVM framework, aiming to enhance the predicted precision and efficiency of the model. The primary focus of this study revolves around the development of an intelligent optimization framework that surpasses conventional machine learning techniques, hence providing a more dynamic and efficient strategy for process improvement. The SVM model’s performance, as assessed against experimental benchmarks, exhibits a notable degree of predictive accuracy and substantial concurrence with observed data. This increase in performance indicates that our methodology has the potential to make a significant contribution to the enhancement of renewable catalysts in gasification processes.

Box 518, Rafsanjan, Iran","The hydropower industry is one of the most important sources of clean energy. Predicting hydropower production is essential for the hydropower industry. This study introduces a hybrid deep learning model to predict hydropower production. Statistical methods are unsuitable for modeling hydropower production because their accuracy depends on seasonal and periodic fluctuations. For accurate predictions, deep learning models can capture daily, weekly, and monthly patterns. Since ANNs may not capture latent and nonlinear patterns, we use deep learning models to predict hydropower production. We used Convolutional Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron-Gaussian Process Regression (CNNE-MUPE-GPRE) to extract key features and predict outcomes. The main advantages of the hybrid model are the quantification of production uncertainty, the accurate prediction of hydropower production, and the extraction of features from input data. We use a binary SSOA to select optimal input scenarios. The new model is benchmarked against the long short term memory neural network (LSTM), Bi directional LSTM (BI-LSTM), MUPE, GPRE, MUPE-GPRE, CNNE-GPRE, and CNNE-MUPE models. The models are used to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-day ahead power. The root mean square error values of CNNE-MUPE-GPRE, CNNE-MUPE, CNNE-GPRE, MUPE-GPRE, BI-LSTM, LSTM, CNNE, MUPE, GPRE were 578, 615, 832, 861, 914, 934, 1436, 1712, and 1954 KW at the 1-day prediction horizon. The RMSE of the CNNE-MUPE-GPRE was 595, 600, and 612 at the 1-day, 2-days, and 3-days prediction horizons. Extending the prediction horizon degrades accuracy. The uncertainty of the CNNE-MUPE-GPRE model was lower than that of the other models. The CNNE-MUPE-GPRE model is recommended for more accurate hydropower production predictions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Deep learning models; Hydropower; Optimization algorithms; Power generation","Convolutional neural networks; Forecasting; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Hydroelectric power; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning model; Gaussian process regression; Hydro power production; Hydropower; Learning models; Multilayers perceptrons; Neural-networks; Optimization algorithms; Power- generations; algorithm; artificial neural network; computer simulation; Gaussian method; hydroelectric power; machine learning; power generation; regression analysis; Multilayer neural networks","M.

In order to evaluate the ability of EVs as mobile energy storage, this paper presents an energy management framework for the microgrids' online dispatch, which accounts for the spatio-temporal energy transmission of EVs between microgrids. The energy management framework contains two iterative processes: optimizing charging price and guiding charging dispatch. To sufficiently capture the uncertainties of the renewable energy and load demand, chance-constrained optimization is utilized to determine the charging price by reasonable power allocation. To achieve a continuous and efficient control policy, a normalized advantage function-deep Q learning network (NAF-DQN) is developed for EV dispatch under V2G technology. The above two processes as a coupled optimization problem are solved alternately until convergence. Numerical cases considering energy transmission of EVs between microgrids are studied to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed dispatch framework. The simulation results indicate improved computational efficiency and higher-quality solution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Chance-constrained optimization; Electric vehicle; Microgrid; Normalized advantage function-deep Q learning network; Uncertainties","Computational efficiency; Constrained optimization; Deep learning; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission; Energy management; Learning systems; Power quality; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicle-to-grid; Chance-constrained optimizations; Energy; Energy transmission; Learning network; Management frameworks; Microgrid; Normalized advantage function-deep Q learning network; Q-learning; Spatio-temporal; Uncertainty; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy management; machine learning; simulation; smart grid; uncertainty analysis; Electric vehicles","F.

To address these issues in a comprehensive manner, this paper proposes a data-driven two-level transactive energy management framework, where the upper-level determines the optimal strategies of internal scheduling within MGs and external trading between MGs while the lower-level formulates a Nash bargaining game model for the fair allocation of trading benefits. The uncertainties of renewable energy sources are fully captured by an adjustable data-driven robust optimization approach with an uncertainty set constructed using the robust kernel density estimation (RKDE) as a machine learning technique. The resulting uncertainty set can provide robust scheduling and trading schemes even when the power generation data of wind turbines and photovoltaic systems are contaminated with anomalous samples, whereas conventional sets are not reliable in the case of contaminated data. To preserve the operational independence and information privacy of MGs, the proposed model is solved in a distributed manner by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the augmented Lagrange-based alternating direction inexact Newton (ALADIN) algorithms. ADMM is commonly used in previous studies, but it has low computational efficiency for handling the consensus process among a large number of MGs. This paper applies ADMM and ALADIN to enhance the applicability of the proposed model when the size and complexity of the networks increase. Numerical tests show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and solution methodology in terms of system cost, solution robustness, and convergence speed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","ADMM; Data-driven optimization; Distributed optimization; Nash bargaining game; Peer-to-peer energy trading","Game theory; Machine design; Machine learning; Microgrids; Optimization; Privacy-preserving techniques; Renewable energy resources; Alternating directions method of multipliers; Data driven; Data-driven optimization; Distributed optimization; Energy trading; Microgrid; Nash bargaining game; Peer to peer; Peer-to-peer energy trading; Uncertainty; Computational efficiency","M.S.

Besides calculating basic bibliometric indicators, we used clustering techniques and a co-occurrence analysis of author keywords to discover and characterize dominant themes in the literature. As a result, we found eight dominant themes in SE (solar energy, smart grids and microgrids, fuel cells, hydrogen, electric vehicles, biofuels, wind energy, and energy planning) and nine dominant techniques in AI (genetic algorithms, support vector machines, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, classical neural networks, fuzzy logic controllers, reinforcement learning, deep learning, and multi-objective optimization).

The current state-of-the-art is to co-optimize the design and operation of integrated energy systems (IES) treating historical or predicted time-series electricity prices as fixed parameters. Recent literature has shown the limitations of this price taker assumption, which neglects how IES optimization decisions influence market outcomes. As such, this paper proposes a new optimization formulation that uses machine learning surrogate models, trained from a library of annual market operation simulations, to embed IES market interactions into the co-optimization problem directly. Using a thermal generator example built in the open-source IDAES computational environment, we show that the price taker approach routinely over-predicts annual revenues by 8% or more compared to a validation simulation, where the proposed approach has a typical relative error of 1% or less. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Computational optimization; Electricity markets; Energy infrastructure; Integrated energy systems; Neural networks; Surrogate modeling","Conceptual design; Electric load dispatching; Neural networks; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Computational optimization; Design and optimization; Electricity-generation system; Energy infrastructures; Integrated energy systems; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Price takers; Renewable energy source; Surrogate modeling; alternative energy; artificial neural network; electricity generation; energy market; machine learning; optimization; price dynamics; Machine learning","A.W.

However, this fact has not drawn sufficient attention in the existing literature. To fill the gap, this article, among the first, investigates the latent cyberthreat incurred by the DL-based REF model. First, a spatiotemporally coordinated cyberattack strategy is proposed by considering attackable geo-distributed renewable energy resources (RESs) and periods. It is fulfilled by compromising meteorological data transmitted from external online weather forecast interfaces which are required for REF but also exposed to potential adversaries. In this manner, the malicious adversary is able to deteriorate the REF performance, thereby jeopardizing the operation of the smart energy system. Second, the cyberattack optimization models under the white-box and black-box scenarios are designed. In the white-box scenario, the adversary has full knowledge of these operator-own REF models to obtain false data that should be injected into the meteorological data for launching cyberattacks; in the black-box scenario, the adversary will train surrogate models to replace these operator-own models for attack guidance. Third, an iterative solving method is proposed to solve the proposed white-box and black-box cyberattack optimization models. As DL models (sealed, non-differentiable, and highly non-linear) are introduced to the optimization problem, conventional optimization solvers are unable to handle the cyberattack optimization problem. The proposed solving method utilizes the proximal gradient descent principle, and is feasible to explore the near-optimal solution to the problem. At last, the efficacy of the proposed cyberattack strategy under different RES penetration levels and attack strengths and its catastrophic impacts are comprehensively assessed on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark. The results reveal that the cyberattack would cause enormous economic losses and even collapse the smart energy system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Data cybersecurity; Deep learning; Renewable energy forecast; Spatiotemporally coordinated cyberattack; White-box and black-box","Deep learning; Gradient methods; Losses; Meteorology; Optimization; Weather forecasting; Black boxes; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Data cybersecurity; Deep learning; Energy forecasts; Renewable energies; Renewable energy forecast; Spatiotemporally coordinated cyberattack; White box; White-box and black-box; alternative energy; assessment method; machine learning; optimization; spatiotemporal analysis; Renewable energy resources","J.

In this study, a dynamic self-learning grid-responsive strategy was proposed to improve techno-economic performances, energy flexibility, and the relative capacity (RC) of electrochemical batteries, through dynamically adjustable off-peak grid charging power. A collaborative framework on an energy district with building-integrated photovoltaics and electric vehicles has been formulated, through synergic energy interactions and integrations. Cycling aging of both static batteries in buildings and mobile vehicle batteries has been considered. In respect to intrinsic contradiction characteristics of each objective, trade-off solutions have been proposed through multi-objective optimisation. Furthermore, regarding the multiple optimal solutions along the Pareto front, a weighted Eulerian distance-based methodology was adopted to identify the ‘best of best’ solution and then assist multi-criteria decision-making. Research results show that, with the proposed dynamic self-learning grid-responsive strategy, the grid can provide a more flexible grid-to-battery charging power with a higher RC of batteries, compared to the strategy with dynamic renewable-demand signals.

To optimize grid operations, enhanced control and management systems are needed given the increased integration of renewable energy sources and the rising demand for sustainable energy options. In order to effectively monitor, regulate, and optimize power and energy systems, this article suggests an intelligent grid management strategy that integrates smart grid technology, cuttingedge analytics, and control algorithms. The suggested intelligent grid management system makes use of real-time data collection from smart metres, sensors, and other grid equipment to facilitate situational awareness and decision-making. In order to analyze the gathered data and extract insights for grid operation and planning, advanced analytics techniques, including as machine learning and optimization algorithms, are utilized. Utilizingthis information will improve power production, load scheduling, energy storage use, and system stability. In order to encourage energy users to modify their energy consumption habits in response to price signals and grid circumstances, the intelligent grid management system also integrates demand response methods. Demand-side management promotes grid stability and resilience by balancing supply and demand, lowering peak loads. In addition, the suggested approach incorporates distributed energy resources (DERs) into the grid management procedure, including solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage devices. To maximize their impact on grid performance overall and improve grid resiliency during emergencies, these DERs are coordinated and controlled in a decentralized way. Case studies and simulation results provide as proof of the efficacy of the intelligent grid management strategy. The grid efficiency, energy costs, grid reliability, and integration of renewable energy sources are all improved by the system. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

Wind power has emerged as an alternative that has contributed to the transition towards cleaner energy. As the importance of wind energy grows, it can be crucial to provide forecasts that optimize its performance potential. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have risen in prominence due to how well they can handle complicated systems while enhancing the accuracy of prediction. This study explored the area of AI to predict wind-energy production at a wind farm in Yalova, Turkey, using four different AI approaches: support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Wind speed and direction were considered as essential input parameters, with wind energy as the target parameter, and models are thoroughly evaluated using metrics such as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The findings accentuate the superior performance of the SVM, which delivered the lowest MAPE (2.42%), the highest R2 (0.95), and the lowest MAE (71.21%) compared with actual values, while ANFIS was less effective in this context. The main aim of this comparative analysis was to rank the models to move to the next step in improving the least efficient methods by combining them with optimization algorithms, such as metaheuristic algorithms. © 2023 Global Energy Interconnection Group Co.

In the present study, the capability of electronic nose (e-nose) system and machine learning approaches was evaluated of classification/prediction of bioethanol production and sensor responses as real-time monitoring. For this purpose, rice and wheat residual were conducted by acid-ultrasound, thermal-acid hydrolysis, and plasma technology, respectively. Then, the prepared substance was poured into both a pneumatic anaerobic digester (PAD) and a mechanical anaerobic digester (MAD). The fermentation process lasted for 20 days and data were acquired every five days. The output of each reactor was examined after the distillation stage. For this purpose, the output bioethanol was injected into an e-nose with an arrangement of 13 sensors, and the feature of the produced bioethanol was investigated by gas sensors. The response of the sensors was predicted and identified by chemometric methods. Moreover, the optimal responses with time and type of digester were investigated by RSM (Response Surface Methodology). The obtained results indicated that given the significance coefficient, the gas sensors MQ135, MQ2, MQ7, MQ9, TGS2620, and TGS822 had the highest rate of detection.

State-of-the-art monitoring devices essential in data-driven VVO frameworks are firstly discussed. How data-driven structures serve as primary or supplementary tools in VVO frameworks is then detailed. Since RL is increasingly used, RL-based algorithms (value-based, policy-based, actor-critic-based, and graph-based algorithms) are reviewed. Decision-making processes for RL-based VVO frameworks, such as the Markov decision process (MDP), Markov game, constrained Markov decision process, constrained Marko game, and adversarial Markov decision process, are also surveyed.

Accurate PV power prediction is critical for building a new power system generation and guaranteeing system stability when a high proportion of renewable energy is connected. Therefore, this research proposes a hybrid prediction method based on multi-scale similar days and ESN-KELM dual-kernel prediction to increase the prediction accuracy of PV power generation. First, the multi-scale similar days algorithm is used to determine similar days of the forecast day as the model training data. This operation can reduce the impact of the randomness of PV power output on the model performance. Second, the hidden features of PV power are mined using a fast iterative filter decomposition method. Based on the complexity of the components, the corresponding ESN-KELM dual-kernel prediction models are established. An improved Archimedes optimization approach is used to optimize the ESN-KELM model's parameters. Next, the predicted power is obtained by aggregating the predicted results of each component. Ultimately, the method is validated using historical operational data from PV power plants. The results indicate that the proposed model can achieve well prediction results for various seasons and weather conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Echo state network; Fast iterative filter decomposition; Improved archimedes algorithm; Kernel extreme learning machine; Multiscale similar days; Photovoltaic power prediction","Forecasting; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Renewable energy resources; Echo state networks; Fast iterative filter decomposition; Filter decomposition; Improved archimede algorithm; Kernel extreme learning machine; Learning machines; Multiscale similar day; Photovoltaic power; Photovoltaic power prediction; Power predictions; Similar day; algorithm; alternative energy; decomposition analysis; machine learning; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; System stability","L.

Carbon emissions primarily stem from energy supply, prompting a shift from Non-Renewable Energy Supply (NRES) to Renewable Energy Supply (RES). However, transitioning to RES entails substantial investment and faces supply uncertainty due to weather dependency. Therefore, the transition should be done gradually, requiring a reliable approach to energy mix modeling. This study proposes a System Dynamics framework integrated with Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) and Machine Learning to optimize the energy mix under supply uncertainty. Due to energy system dynamicity, the proposed framework considers not only supply, but also demand, energy storage, electric vehicle, and emission subsystems. The experiment has been conducted by taking the United States as a case under various scenarios namely to minimize the total system cost, total carbon emissions, and both, accounting for the static and dynamic cost of RES. Results of this study reveal four main points: (i) A 38% reduction in total system cost is achievable by decreasing the RES Ratio to 6%, but total emissions will rise by 8%; (ii) A 55% reduction in total emissions is possible by directly transitioning to 100% RES, but total system cost increases by 68%; (iii) Both objective functions can be significantly minimized at a time by increasing the RES ratio; (iv) Dynamic cost offers a better opportunity for reducing costs and emissions than static cost. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Energy mix; Energy system; Green; Optimization; System dynamics","United States; Carbon; Cost reduction; Global warming; Hybrid systems; Investments; Renewable energy resources; System theory; Uncertainty analysis; Energy mix; Energy mix model; Energy supplies; Energy systems; Green; Optimisations; Renewable energies; Supply uncertainty; System costs; System Dynamics; cost analysis; electricity supply; emission control; energy storage; global warming; machine learning; optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Z.U.

At the same time, machine learning techniques provide more opportunities to study the complex power system security and stability problems. This article summarizes the machine learning framework to embed security rules into power system operation optimization under high renewable energy penetration. First, we explore how high penetration renewable energy impacts power system security and stability. Then, we review how the complex security and stability boundary of power systems is modeled using various machine learning techniques.

The system is modelled for net power production of 15 MW thermal output utilizing equations for the energy and exergy balance for each component. Subsequently, thermodynamic model extracted dataset used for prediction & evaluation of Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, AdaBoost, ANN and LightGBM algorithm. Finally, considering climate conditions, multi-objective optimization is carried out for the CSP integrated sCO2 Power cycle for optimal power output, exergy destruction, thermal and exergetic efficiency. Genetic algorithm and TOPSIS (technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution), multi-objective decision-making tool, were used to determine the optimum operating conditions. The major findings of this work reveal significant improvements in the performance of the advanced sCO2 cycle by 1.68 % and 7.87 % compared to conventional recompression and partial cooling cycle, respectively. This research could advance renewable energy technologies, particularly concentrated solar power, by improving power cycle designs to increase system efficiency and economic feasibility. Optimized advanced supercritical CO2 power cycles in concentrated solar power plants might increase renewable energy use and energy generation infrastructure, potentially opening new research avenues. © 2023 The Author(s)","Artificial neural network; Concentrated solar power; Machine learning; Multi-objective optimization; Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>; Thermodynamic analysis","Carbon dioxide; Concentration (process); Decision making; Energy policy; Forestry; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Solar energy; Concentrated solar power; Energy and exergy; Machine-learning; Multi-objective performance optimizations; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization analysis; Power cycle; Recompression; Supercritical CO 2; Thermo dynamic analysis; Concentrated solar power","M.M.

These sources are limited in nature and quantity. Additionally, they are continuously diminishing as global energy consumption increases as a result of population growth and industrial expansion. Their compensation is made from clean energy and renewable energy. Renewable energy is strongly dependent on climatic conditions; therefore, an aspect of energy management is needed, which is essential in distribution systems, because it enables us to calculate the precise energy used by the load as well as by its many components. It also helps us understand how much energy is required and its origin. The energy management aspect contains two main phases: forecasting and optimization. In this study, we are focused on the forecasting level using intelligent machine learning (ML) techniques. To ensure better energy management, it is very important to predict the production of renewable energy over a wide time period. In our work, several cases are proposed in order to predict the temperature, the irradiance, and the power produced by a PV system. The proposed approach is validated by an experimental procedure and a real database for a PV system. The big data from the sensors are noisy, which pose a major problem for forecasting. To reduce the impact of noise, we applied the multiscale strategy. To evaluate this strategy, we used different performance criteria, such as mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), nRMSE and the coefficient of determination ((Formula presented.)). The obtained experimental results show good performance with lower error. Indeed, they achieved an error for nRMSE criteria between 0.01 and 0.37. © 2023 by the authors.","energy management (EM); forecasting; photovoltaic (PV); stand-alone PV system","Electric power distribution; Energy management; Energy utilization; Errors; Machine learning; Mean square error; Population statistics; Energy management; Machine learning techniques; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic power; Photovoltaic systems; Photovoltaics; Power forecasting; Renewable energies; Stand alone photovoltaic system; Forecasting","M.

However, the large-scale involvement of green energy leads to the creation of distributed energy networks that combine several different generation methods, each of which has its own specific features, and as a result, the data collection and processing necessary to optimize the operation of such energy systems become more relevant. Development of new technologies for the more optimal use of RES is one of the main tasks of modern research in the field of energy, where an important place is assigned to the use of technologies based on artificial intelligence, allowing researchers to significantly increase the efficiency of the use of all types of RES within energy systems. This paper proposes to consider the methodology of application of modern approaches to the assessment of the amount of energy obtained from renewable energy sources based on artificial intelligence technologies, approaches used for data processing and for optimization of the control processes for operating energy systems with the integration of renewable energy sources. The relevance of the work lies in the formation of a general approach applied to the evaluation of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy based on the use of artificial intelligence technologies. As a verification of the approach considered by the authors, a number of models for predicting the amount of solar power generation using photovoltaic panels have been implemented, for which modern machine-learning methods have been used. As a result of testing for quality and accuracy, the best results were obtained using a hybrid forecasting model, which combines the joint use of a random forest model applied at the stage of the normalization of the input data, exponential smoothing model, and LSTM model. © 2024 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; digital twins; forecasting; LSTM; machine learning; neural networks; renewable energy","Data handling; E-learning; Forestry; Long short-term memory; Natural resources; Solar energy; Solar energy conversion; Solar power generation; Wind power; Artificial intelligence technologies; Energy; Energy evaluation; Energy systems; LSTM; Machine-learning; Neural-networks; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar and wind energies; Forecasting","A.

Households can save money and be more comfortable with automated appliances. The cost of electricity and user comfort are fundamentally contradictory, so they can be presented as a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem with fluctuating priorities for the customer to use various devices at different times. For this reason, this paper proposes an advanced Intelligent Home Energy Management (IHEM) approach based on reinforcement learning to achieve home demand response (DR) efficiency. The optimal formulation of the one-hour-ahead energy consumption scheduling problem is considered a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with discrete time steps. An efficient Neural Network (NN)-based approach with a Q-learning algorithm is developed to address this problem, enabling the IHEM system to achieve better cost-effective scheduling performance. The accurate data of electricity price and energy supplied by the Photovoltaic (PV) system are analyzed in sliding periods by machine learning for uncertainty prediction. Using the newly developed approach, which has the dual objective of minimizing the electricity bill, it is possible to obtain scheduling decisions for appliances and energy storage. The results show that the proposed optimization method reduces the monthly electricity costs by 20% compared to the Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based HEMS method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Appliance scheduling; Artificial neural network; Intelligent home energy system; Optimization; Reinforcement learning","Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Uncertainty analysis; Appliance scheduling; Energy systems; Home automation; Home energy management systems; Intelligent home; Intelligent home energy system; Learning models; Optimisations; Reinforcement learnings; Renewable energies; Reinforcement learning","S.

Nevertheless, the integration of a large amount of wind power, with an intermittent nature, into the grid and the variability of the load on the demand side require an efficient and reliable energy management system (EMS) for operation, scheduling, maintenance and energy trading in the modern power system. This article proposes a new Energy Management Protocol (EMP) based on the combination of Machine Learning (ML) and Game-Theoretic (GT) algorithms to manage the operation of the charging/discharging of EVs from an energy storage system (ESS) via EV supply equipment (EVSE) when the main source of energy is wind power. The ESS can be linked to the grid to overcome downtimes of wind power production. Case study results of wind power forecasting using an ML algorithm and 10 min wind measurements, combined with a GT optimization model, showed good performance in the forecasting and management of power dispatching between EVs to ensure the efficient and accurate operation of the power system. © 2023 by the authors.","electric vehicles; game-theoretic model; machine learning; wind energy management system","Electric load dispatching; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Fossil fuels; Game theory; Machine learning; Carbon neutralities; Game-theoretic; Game-theoretic model; Large amounts; Machine-learning; Management protocols; Power; Renewable energy source; Storage systems; Wind energy management system; Wind power","D.

Various combinations of the attached household appliances lead to specific operating states, related to the charge and load switching-time in different out-side conditions. Complexity and irregularities require modelling with the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to represent the uncertainty in load transitions and RE power oscillations. These specifics cannot be numerically solved with respect to unexpected states in detached micro-grid systems showing great variability. Recent Differential Learning, developed by the author, using a novel designed neuro-computing approach, enables one to model high non-linear and indefinable chaotic physical systems. The optimal training periods of day-set records were initially pre-assessed, based on AI input-output statistics. This model initialization allows operable day-ahead PQ-predictions in processing the last 24-hour series in one sequence. The proposed 2-level PQ-management evaluates initial load scheduling plans, based on available RE and storage sources. System efficiency and failure-free operations are planned considering the first estimate of its day-ahead PVP supply and secondary PQ verification of the provided load utilization schemes, under various state charges and RE production limits. This is a novelty with a notable incremental improvement in the published combinatorial optimization algorithms, only scheduling applicable load components, and reassessing the allowable power-day resources. Off-grid optimal operations can be determined and regulated by an adequate early morning PQ evaluation in RE utilization.

It contains the predictive of electricity consumption forms over certain time intervals. Load Forecasting remains a stimulating task as load data has exhibited changing patterns because of factors such as weather change and shifts in energy usage behaviour. The beginning of advanced data analytics and machine learning (ML) approaches; particularly deep learning (DL) has mostly enhanced load forecasting accuracy. Deep neural networks (DNNs) namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved popularity for their capability to capture difficult temporal dependencies in load data. This study designs a Short-Load Forecasting scheme using a Hybrid Deep Learning and Beluga Whale Optimization (LFS-HDLBWO) approach. The major intention of the LFS-HDLBWO technique is to predict the load in the SG environment. To accomplish this, the LFS-HDLBWO technique initially uses a Z-score normalization approach for scaling the input dataset. Besides, the LFS-HDLBWO technique makes use of convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory with an autoencoder (CBLSTM-AE) model for load prediction purposes. Finally, the BWO algorithm could be used for optimal hyperparameter selection of the CBLSTM-AE algorithm, which helps to enhance the overall prediction results. A wide-ranging experimental analysis was made to illustrate the better predictive results of the LFS-HDLBWO method. The obtained value demonstrates the outstanding performance of the LFS-HDLBWO system over other existing DL algorithms with a minimum average error rate of 3.43 and 2.26 under FE and Dayton grid datasets, respectively.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; bio-inspired algorithm; Energy management; hyperparameter optimization; short-term prediction","Brain; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Electric load forecasting; Electric power plant loads; Energy management systems; Long short-term memory; Renewable energy; Smart power grids; Beluga whales; Bio-inspired algorithms; Features extraction; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Load forecasting; Load modeling; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; Short term prediction; Usability; Energy management","M.M.

Ensuring the safety of the battery and the operation requirements of other types of equipment to the extent possible while achieving the optimization goal has become an important challenge in the implementation of this system. In this case, model predictive control (MPC) has gained increasing attention in the operation control of BES owing to its strong fitting ability. However, the prediction models at the core of MPC are not adequately designed for the BES optimization problem, and numerous studies have not yet been modeled and tested in real buildings. In this study, we used a long- and short-term hybrid prediction model in the MPC framework. The proposed prediction models and MPC framework were validated using a measured dataset from a real office building in Japan. The results show that, compared with the currently used baseline control logic, the proposed hybrid prediction MPC framework can improve the battery safety index by 81.6%, while the combined heat and power continuous operation index can also be improved by 36.4%. Compared with the conventional MPC framework, the proposed hybrid prediction MPC framework improves the optimization of off-grid operation by approximately 69% while maintaining the remaining optimization objectives. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Hybrid prediction model; Model predictive control; Renewable building energy system","Deep learning; Electric batteries; Forecasting; Office buildings; Predictive control systems; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Building energy systems; Control framework; Deep learning; Energy systems; Hybrid prediction models; In-buildings; Model-predictive control; Prediction modelling; Renewable building energy system; Solar photovoltaics; alternative energy; comparative study; computer simulation; machine learning; numerical model; optimization; renewable resource; Model predictive control","Y.

However, older generations using boilers represent a large proportion of systems currently in operation, and significantly contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, operational data has become increasingly available for these older generation systems and represents a suitable opportunity for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based modelling and advanced controls. In this context, model predictive control (MPC) has appeared as a powerful control solution; however, field implementation remains relatively scarce. This paper aims to develop an AI-based MPC strategy for multi-boiler district heating systems. It relies on heating load forecasting machine learning models and data-driven boiler performance curves to optimize boiler thermal outputs. This strategy was implemented in two Canadian demonstration sites and showed GHG emissions reductions of 1.3 % and 2.8 %. Although relatively modest, statistical analysis confirmed the realization of these savings. In absolute terms, the strategy helped avoid 45 t and 77 t CO2eq emissions and save $10,268 and $19,975 CAD during the testing period of 2–3 months.

Accurate prediction of energy demand and CO2 emissions is an important method to tackle the challenge. In addition, as a major source of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, the transportation sector is at the center of the problem. This study employs a hybrid approach integrating a multi-objective mathematical model with data-driven machine learning algorithms to predict energy demand and CO2 emissions in the transportation sector with improved accuracy. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the impact of individual and joint consumptions of different energy resources on CO2 emissions. Case studies are conducted with countrywide statistics in Canada where the prediction indicates that energy demand and CO2 emissions will increase by 34.72% and 50.02% from 2019 to 2048 in the Canadian transportation sector. Results also indicated the varied impacts of different energy resources such that a 5% increase in energy demand in oil, gas, electricity, and renewable energy will result in + 4.8%, +0.315%, +0.28%, and −0.51% changes in CO2 emissions respectively.

Coordinated management of the microgrid components is crucial for their effectiveness, and this can be very challenging when hosting solar or wind generation. This paper studies the energy management problem of a microgrid based on reinforcement learning algorithms. The advantage of using these algorithms against other optimization and machine learning techniques is that they do not need past experiences to learn a strategy. The learning is based on trial and error experiences, which facilitates its easy implementation to other microgrids while demonstrating their facility to be applied in real cases. In particular, this paper proposes an implementation for an Energy Management System (EMS) in microgrids using the Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm.

The efficiency of Electric Vehicles (EVs) are highly depends on the precise measurement of significant factors, as well as on the appropriate operation and analysis of the battery storage system. Unfortunately, inadequate battery storage system monitoring and safety measures can result in serious problems such battery over-charging, over-discharging, overloading, imbalanced cells, heat explosion, and combustion hazards. The quantity of a battery’s energy in respect to its capability is described to as the state of charge (SOC). SOC is measured in percentage points and is estimated as the distance between the battery’s maximum possible output and its average energy at a specific time under the same issues. State of health (SOH) is the evaluation of a battery’s maximum charge amount compared to its starting value when it is first discharged. SOH is calculated using percentage points as its variables. An efficient battery management system, which includes tailored to the content, charging-discharging control, thermal regulation, battery protection and security, is essential for addressing these issues.

Expanding real-time matching between renewable energy generation and building energy demand can help realize more enormous zero-energy potential in practice. However, there are few studies to investigate the real-time energy matching in renewable energy building design. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid ensemble learning framework is proposed for analyzing and predicting zero-energy potential in the real-time matching of photovoltaic direct-driven air conditioner (PVAC) systems. First, the datasets of zero-energy probability (ZEP) are generated under the three main climate regions in China, which are with consideration of the load flexibility of air conditioners and based on six important design variables. Second, a novel ensemble learning method named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is selected to predict ZEP and the Bayesian Optimization (BO) is adopted to identify the optimal hyperparameters and further improve the prediction performance. The statistical analysis shows that ZEP distributions are very different from one region to another one and the PVAC systems in Beijing are the easiest to achieve the zero-energy goal. Among all the variables, PV capacity is the most significant and positively related to ZEP. The prediction results show BO-XGBoost achieves more than 99% accuracy and outperforms other benchmark models in the ZEP prediction of three cities. In a word, this paper reveals BO-XGBoost is the most effective model for ZEP prediction and provides the framework for designers to utilize zero-energy potential analysis and prediction for the first time. © 2022 The Authors","Bayesian optimization; Machine learning; Photovoltaic direct-driven air conditioners; Thermal comfort; Zero energy potential","Air conditioning; Architectural design; Domestic appliances; Learning systems; Machine learning; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Air conditioner; Bayesian optimization; Direct-driven; Energy-potentials; Ensemble learning; Machine-learning; Photovoltaic direct-driven air conditioner; Photovoltaics; Zero energies; Zero energy potential; Forecasting","S.

While previous studies have focused on planning methods to minimize electricity costs, recent years have seen an increasing need for energy management methods that consider environmental performance, such as CO2 emissions, alongside economic efficiency. This study proposes a mechanism to support stakeholders’ decision-making by calculating Pareto solutions based on the multi-objective optimization of economic and environmental characteristics for entities that own renewable energy generation facilities. Unlike many existing studies that assume a specific equation for COP (Coefficient of Performance) estimation, this study adopts a nonparametric COP estimation method using machine learning, resulting in a more realistic and flexible modeling of the system. The study also presents a model for selecting an operation strategy that balances environmental and economic goals, incorporating a thermal storage facility to improve the renewable energy rate. Specifically, we proposed and compared methods for calculating solutions using only the GA (Genetic Algorithm) and a two-step optimization method combining a GA and gradient-based optimization method, confirming the superiority of the two-step optimization method. The case study unveiled unique operational profiles corresponding to cost-saving, renewable-energy, and balanced orientation points, suggesting the existence of specific strategies tailored to each orientation.

The proposed HRES is optimized using the recently developed equilibrium optimizer algorithm and the efficacy of this algorithm is investigated by comparing the optimized sizing with results obtained from more traditional optimization algorithms, i.e., gray wolf optimizer, lightning search algorithm, and artificial bee colony. The results indicate that using the equilibrium optimizer algorithm outperforms conventional optimization algorithms in minimizing the levelized cost of electricity to $0.83 per kWh. This proves applicability of this modern optimization algorithm in improving HRES, which is a novelty of this research. Moreover, machine learning is implemented to predict the exergy efficiency of the proposed HRES, which provides insight into the performance and sustainability of the system. A thermodynamic database is established to train the machine learning model using secondary data. Using the multi-layer perceptron class, the exergy efficiency of the system is predicted; the trained model is able to deliver a prediction with an R-Squared value of 0.98. Thus, the appropriateness of machine learning algorithms in predicting the performance of HRES is verified. This research will, therefore, pave the way towards expanding real-world application of HRES's. This study provides insights into the optimization and economic and environmental benefits of hybrid renewable energy systems and inform policymakers on how to incentivize their implementation.

One of these sources is solar chimneys. The region where a solar chimney is installed is important for its efficiency, and if the energy to be produced from the solar chimney can be determined, comments can be made about the region where it will be installed. In determining the energy to be produced from a solar chimney, the chimney inlet temperature must be known. In this study, it is planned to make an application on a solar chimney in Isparta province. First, a prototype solar chimney was installed on the campus of Süleyman Demirel University (SDU) by the SDU Renewable Energy Resources Research and Application Center. A unique data set was created with input data from sensors in the collector area of the solar chimney and output data from a sensor located at the mouth of the chimney. In this study, the flue inlet temperature values were estimated by using 10 different regression methods, one of which was a model specific to this study. In addition, hyperparameter adjustments of the regression models were made with different optimization methods. With Random Forest- Elastic-Lasso.Net (REL.Net) and ElasticNet architecture among the 10 methods, the chimney inlet temperature was obtained with accuracy rate of approximately 99 %.

A real-time smart voltage control framework of cyber-physical social power systems is proposed to replace the traditional multi-timescale “reactive power optimization and voltage regulation” framework. This work combines artificial emotion, deep learning, and Q learning as an artificial emotional deep Q-learning algorithm. The proposed framework and algorithm are simulated in the developed parallel smart voltage control platform. The proposed algorithm has a strong-robust capability of real-time online updating, learning, and decision-making. Furthermore, four virtual systems simulating the actual smart voltage control systems are built. Compared to the conventional proportional-integral-derivative, the voltage deviation of the proposed algorithm is reduced by 68.95%. Among six uniform time-scale algorithms, the proposed algorithm has the highest control performance and the lowest control error.

Developing nations, including India, are strategically implementing wind power initiatives in regions characterized by high annual average wind speeds. However, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of meteorological variables, wind energy production lacks a predictable schedule. Consequently, the energy sector faces the challenge of accurately forecasting wind velocity to effectively manage and optimize wind electricity generation. This research aims at Andhra Pradesh, India, to see whether wind energy is feasible. This paper presents a multilayer perceptron-neural network (MLP-NN) forecasting model that utilizes machine learning. The model extracts features with the Harris Hawks Optimization-K-Nearest Neighbors (HHO-KNN) technique. By employing this strategy, open-access data gathering will be used to improve wind power predictions.

The optimization process is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) also known as security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). Independent system operators (ISOs) run SCUC daily and require state-of-the-art algorithms to speed up the process. Existing patterns in historical information can be leveraged for model reduction of SCUC, which can provide significant time savings. In this paper, machine learning (ML) based classification approaches, namely logistic regression, neural networks, random forest and K-nearest neighbor, were studied for model reduction of SCUC. The ML was then aided with a feasibility layer (FL) and post-process technique to ensure high quality solutions. The proposed approach is validated on several test systems namely, IEEE 24-Bus system, IEEE-73 Bus system, IEEE 118-Bus system, South-Carolina (SC) synthetic grid 500-Bus system, and Polish 2383-Bus system. Moreover, model reduction of a stochastic SCUC (SSCUC) was demonstrated utilizing a modified IEEE 24-Bus system with renewable generation.

Coal, natural gas, and petroleum are examples of fossil fuels that are not replenished and are thus non-renewable energy sources due to their high carbon content and the methods by which they are generated. To predict energy production of renewable sources, researchers use energy forecasting techniques based on the recent advances in machine learning approaches. Numerous prediction methods have significant drawbacks, including high computational complexity and inability to generalize for various types of sources of renewable energy sources. Methodology: In this paper, we proposed a novel approach capable of generalizing the prediction accuracy for both wind speed and solar radiation forecasting data. The proposed approach is based on a new optimization algorithm and a new stacked ensemble model. The new optimization algorithm is a hybrid of Al-Biruni Earth Radius (BER) and genetic algorithm (GA) and it is denoted by the GABER optimization algorithm. This algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the proposed stacked ensemble model to boost the prediction accuracy and to improve the generalization capability. Results: To evaluate the proposed approach, several experiments are conducted to study its effectiveness and superiority compared to other optimization methods and forecasting models. In addition, statistical tests are conducted to assess the significance and difference of the proposed approach. The recorded results proved the proposed approach’s superiority, effectiveness, generalization, and statistical significance when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: The proposed approach is capable of predicting both wind speed and solar radiation with better generalization. © 2023 by the authors.","Al-Biruni earth radius algorithm; artificial intelligence; genetic algorithm; machine learning; parameter optimization; renewable energy","Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Natural resources; Parameter estimation; Renewable energy resources; Solar radiation; Wind; Al-biruni earth radius algorithm; Earth radii; Energy forecasting; Ensemble models; Machine-learning; Optimization algorithms; Parameter optimization; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Wind speed; Machine learning","A.A.

While, more than a half of its population lives in big cities, buildings are responsible for nearly the 40 % of the global annual energy consumption. Recent advances in smart grids and the high penetration of renewable energy sources have increased the need for long-term buildings' electricity consumption prediction to support operational decision making, demand response, and the installation of distributed generation systems. In addition, to meet international environmental goals, electric utilities usually offer financial incentives to reduce consumption levels. Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems use the half of the buildings' energy to maintain users' comfort. In this scenario, predicting and optimizing their long-term electricity consumption without neglecting comfort conditions become vital to negotiate beneficious service-level agreements (SLAs) within the framework of demand-side management strategies. In this paper, we predict and optimize the one-year-ahead HVAC electricity consumption profile of a reference office building based on a machine learning approach. Although the occupants' number influences the HVAC electricity consumption, there has long been a lack of high-resolution, non-Boolean, long-term occupancy estimators. In this context, we first forecast the one-year-ahead occupants' number schedule and then use it, together with traditionally used historical weather data, to predict the one-year-ahead HVAC electricity consumption. The consumption profile is then optimized based on the estimated one-year-ahead occupants’ count schedule. The best results, obtained with a feedforward neural network, achieve 33 % annual electricity saving without neglecting summer cooling conditions in a hot zone like Miami, being efficient even in energetic-demanding scenarios such as extended working hours. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","And air-conditioning electricity consumption prediction and optimization; Heating; Long-term electricity consumption prediction and optimization in buildings; Machine learning based electricity consumption prediction; occupants'count schedule estimation; Ventilation","Decision making; Electric power utilization; Electric utilities; HVAC; Machine learning; Office buildings; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; And air-conditioning electricity consumption prediction and optimization; Electricity-consumption; In-buildings; Long-term electricity consumption prediction and optimization in building; Machine learning based electricity consumption prediction; Machine-learning; Occupant'count schedule estimation; Optimisations; Forecasting","M.

Nonetheless, enhancing PV self-consumption through technical solutions such as Energy Storage Systems (ESS) is getting higher importance to increase the profitability of PV plants, by minimizing the building-grid interaction. In this context, analyzing PV self-consumption of different energy storage configurations becomes more relevant and crucial in building energy modeling although it is heavily time-consuming and complicated, particularly within a multi-objective optimization related to the ESS design. As a solution to resolve this issue, this paper evaluates the accuracy, training, and prediction speed of 24 Machine Learning (ML) models to be used as surrogate models for analyzing PV self-consumption in smart buildings. Furthermore, the performance of short-term Thermal Energy Storage (TES) to increase PV self-consumption is assessed and presented using ML models. The results showed the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Neural Networks (NN) including bilayered and trilayered NN models, Support Vector Machines (SVM) including the fine gaussian and cubic SVM models, and Ensembles of Trees (EoT) as superior ML models. The results also revealed that TES systems can efficiently increase PV self-consumption in the building equipped with electric heat pumps to provide heating, cooling, and domestic hot water. Moreover, the TES size optimization regarding the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) showed that the LCC-based optimum TES size can yield 7.1% savings within 30 years of the building service life. The novelties of this research are first to provide a reference to select the most suitable ML models in predicting PV self-consumption, second to implement machine learning for analyzing the performance of short-term thermal energy storage to enhance PV self-consumption in buildings, and third to carry out an LCC-based optimization on TES size using ML-based prediction models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Accuracy; LCC; Machine learning; Prediction; PV self-consumption; Thermal energy storage","Buildings; Cooling systems; Costs; Heat storage; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Support vector machines; Thermal energy; Accuracy; In-buildings; Life cycle cost; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Photovoltaic self-consumption; Photovoltaics; Storage systems; Thermal energy storage; accuracy assessment; building; cost analysis; energy storage; life cycle analysis; machine learning; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; prediction; Forecasting","H.

Their inherent unpredictability and output fluctuations pose challenges to secure power system operations and energy market pricing stability. Therefore, an accurate forecast of renewable energy generation is crucial. Several effective forecasting methods that have been applied are based on Machine Learning (ML). A key factor in the application of ML methods is the choice of input features, a task that has become more complex in regional wind power forecasting, where regions can cover entire countries. The proposed method aims to improve forecasting performance by streamlining input features through a data-driven model-agnostic preprocessing technique. This involves splitting the multidimensional numerical weather predictions into subareas and eliminating non-informative subareas. The selection of optimal split and remove parameters is guided by a Bayesian sequential optimisation process, which builds on prior knowledge from previous iterations. The proposed method has been implemented on actual wind power measurements aggregated at regional level for three countries located in Southeastern Europe to demonstrate the effectiveness in improving the performance of popular data-driven forecasting methods.

This paper investigates the impact of renewable energy production on price forecasting using data from the Nord pool market’s electricity market. The primary goal is to present a framework for forecasting market settlement prices using a hybrid wavelet-particle swarm optimization-artificial neural network (W-PSO-ANN). In two scenarios, the results showed that the proposed model accurately represents data and is more precise than the ANN and WANN models. Machine learning has demonstrated promise in predicting electricity prices, but it is not without limitations. The ANN, WANN, and W-PSO-ANN models have training phase RMSE indices of 0.09, 0.07, and 0.04 respectively. During testing, the values were 0.15, 0.11, and 0.08. This demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms previous models. © 2023 University of Mohaghegh Ardabili.

The best specifications of PCM, including type and thickness are found based on a multi-objective optimization. Five technical objectives are considered. They are the amount of production of each of the products. On the other hand, levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and payback period (PBP) are the representative of economic side in the multi-objective optimization. For lower computation time and cost, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been employed to calculate the amount of heat transfer between solar system (PV and solar collector) and PCM. The created ANN is developed using data generated by lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). It has been then validated and applied for conducting the multi-objective optimization based on techno-economic and thermo-electrical viewpoints, as mentioned. The results have shown that by application of the multi-objective optimization, 16.4, 12.7, 8.4, 10.3, and 9.5% more electricity, heating, cooling, hydrogen, and water production compared to the reference condition (system without PCM) are achieved, respectively.

To cool photovoltaic panels in more efficiently maner, understanding heat pipes, nanofluids, and panels interaction play key roles. For analysis and optimization, hybrid models of convolutional neural network (CNN) and firefly optimization algorithm are employed. The firefly optimization algorithm is used to optimize the thermosiphon heat pipe's operational conditions, taking into account inputs such as the filling ratio, nanofluid concentration and panel angle. The study compared the predicted outcomes of a classic CNN model to laboratory experiments. While the CNN model was consistent with experimental findings, it struggled to predict high power values with precision. The proposed model improved high power value predictions by 4.05 W root mean square error (RMSE). The proposed model outperformed the classic CNN model for values greater than 50 W, with an RMSE of 3.95 W. The optimal values for the filling ratio, nanofluid concentration and panel angle were determined after optimization with the firefly algorithm. The research contributes to the advancement of renewable energy technologies and the optimization of photovoltaic panel cooling and energy production. Nanofluid with 1% mass concentration improves photovoltaic collector thermal efficiency due to its higher thermal conductivity coefficient. The photovoltaic collector's electrical efficiency peaks in the morning, drops at noon due to temperature and radiation and recovers by morning. Electrical efficiency is best with nanofluid at 0.86%. Exergy efficiency closely matches electrical efficiency, with nanofluid at the optimal percentage achieving the highest efficiency and water cooling the lowest. © 2024 The Author(s).

This trend aims not only to mitigate carbon emissions but also to enhance the overall efficiency and performance of these power generation facilities. However, calculating the performance of such intricate systems using fundamental thermodynamic equations proves to be both laborious and time-intensive. Nevertheless, possessing accurate and real-time insights into their performance is of utmost significance to ensure optimal plant operation, facilitate decision making, and streamline power production planning. This paper explores the novel application of machine learning techniques to predict the performance of hybrid thermal power plants, specifically the integrated solar combined cycle power plant (ISCCPP). These plants combine conventional thermal power generation with renewable energy sources, making them crucial in the context of carbon reduction and enhanced efficiency. We employ three machine learning approaches: the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), ANFIS optimized via particle swarm optimization (ANFIS-PSO), and ANFIS optimized through a genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA). These methods are applied to the complex ISCCPP, comprising steam and gas turbine sections and a concentrated solar power system. The results highlight the accuracy of ANFIS-based models in evaluating and predicting plant performance, with an exceptional overall correlation coefficient of 0.9991. Importantly, integrating evolutionary algorithms (PSO and GA) into ANFIS significantly enhances performance, yielding correlation coefficients of 0.9994 for ANFIS-PSO and 0.9997 for ANFIS-GA, with ANFIS-GA outperforming the others. This research provides a robust tool for designers, energy managers, and decision makers, offering valuable support in assessing the performance of hybrid thermal power plants. As the world transitions to cleaner energy sources, the insights gained here are poised to have a significant impact on the growing number of these thermal power plants globally. © 2023 by the authors.","adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); ANFIS-GA; ANFIS-PSO; evolutionary algorithms; genetic algorithm (GA); hybrid thermal power plant; integrated solar combined cycle power plant (ISCCPP); particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","L.K.

Nowadays, reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used in IES real-time dispatch to deal with the uncertainty of renewable energy. However, traditional RL algorithms often face the problem of dimensionality when there are numerous controllable units in the system, which will increase operating costs and training time significantly. Based on the above issues, we developed a novel real-time dispatch method for IES with RL model training in stages based on the dueling double deep quality network (D3QN). Dispatches of different controllable units in IES are decomposed into a multi-stage training process according to the degree of thermoelectric coupling and the complexity of equipment operation. This makes the action space of each training stage independent, alleviating the problem of extra-large action space in the traditional RL method. In addition, an improved action-choosing strategy is proposed to enhance local optimization in the process of algorithm training by introducing “offset” according to probability in the training progress. The simulations were carried out on four different types of days in an IES. The results show that the proposed method can effectively reduce operating costs and accelerate convergence. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Improved action-choosing strategy; Integrated energy system; Multi-stage reinforcement learning; Real-time dispatch; Uncertainty","Electric load dispatching; Learning systems; Operating costs; Real time systems; Action spaces; Improved action-choosing strategy; Integrated energy systems; Multi-stage reinforcement learning; Multi-stages; Real-time dispatch; Reinforcement learnings; Renewable energies; Traditional reinforcements; Uncertainty; algorithm; alternative energy; machine learning; optimization; uncertainty analysis; Reinforcement learning","L.

In recent years, with the successful application of big data technology and the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technology represented by deep learning and reinforcement learning in many fields, its application in renewable energy power forecasting is still in the ascendant. This paper first briefly discusses the theoretical basis of AI technology in the application of renewable energy power forecasting, and systematically summarizes the application of AI technology in wind power and photovoltaic power forecasting, including the application of various data processing technologies such as data enhancement and feature construction, application of traditional machine learning, deep learning, combined algorithms in model construction, the application of evolutionary algorithm, swarm intelligence optimization, reinforcement learning, and other intelligent optimization algorithms in model training and hyperparameter optimization. Then, the current related literature is statistically analyzed. Based on the results of the renewable energy forecasting contest as well as the actual forecasting system research situation, the current academic research hotspots and trends, and the application of industrial models are compared and analyzed. Finally, some problems existing in the current renewable energy power forecasting in scene adaptation few-shot learning, numerical weather prediction (NWP) data spatio-temporal resolution, distributed renewable energy prediction, etc. are analyzed, and the prospects of a variety of AI technologies such as reinforcement learning, meta-learning, graph neural network(GNN), to solve related problems are prospected. © 2023 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

Renewable energy resources are challenged by their dependency on unpredictable weather conditions. For instance, solar energy hinges on clear skies, and wind energy relies on consistent and sufficient wind flow. However, as a consequence of the finite supply and detrimental environmental impact associated with non-renewable energy sources, it is required to reduce dependence on such non-renewable sources. This can be achieved by precisely predicting the generation of renewable energy using a data-driven approach. The prediction accuracy for electric load plays a very significant role in this system. If we have an appropriate estimate of residential and commercial load, then a strategy could be defined for the efficient supply to them by renewable and non-renewable energy sources through a smart grid, which analyzes the demand-supply and devises the supply mechanism accordingly. Predicting all such components, i.e., power generation and load forecasting, involves a data-driven approach where sensitive data (such as user electricity consumption patterns and weather data near power generation setups) is used for model training, raising the issue of data privacy and security concerns. Hence, the work proposes Federated Smart Grid (FedGrid), a secure framework that would be able to predict the generation of renewable energy and forecast electric load in a privacy-oriented approach through federated learning. The framework collectively analyzes all such predictive models for efficient electric supply. © 2023 by the authors.","federated learning; load prediction; power generation prediction; privacy-preserving machine learning; renewable energy; smart grid","Environmental impact; Forecasting; Machine learning; Meteorology; Privacy-preserving techniques; Sensitive data; Smart power grids; Solar energy; Wind power; Federated learning; Generation predictions; Load predictions; Machine-learning; Power generation prediction; Power- generations; Privacy preserving; Privacy-preserving machine learning; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Electric loads","A.

However, in the residential sector of tropical countries where HVAC systems are not necessary, these loads represent only a small percentage of the total energy consumption. In order to achieve a significant impact on energy savings and promote the use of RES, other residential loads must be taken into account in tropical countries. In the case of Colombia, for example, fridges account for 24% of residential energy consumption. This research proposes the use of RL for the development of a fridge energy management system capable of minimizing energy consumption and optimizing the use of RES for cooling. The fridge energy management system is based on an RL agent to control the fridge, and an artificial neural network to model the environment and assess the impact of its actions. Compared to the original fridge control, the RL-based control successfully reduced the total energy usage by 23% while also increasing the use of RES energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial Intelligence; Energy saving; Fridge control; Reinforcement learning; Renewable energy sources","Air conditioning; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Housing; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Renewable energy resources; Tropics; Conditioning systems; Energy  savings; Energy-consumption; Energy-savings; Fridge control; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Reinforcement learnings; Renewable energy source; Total energy; Tropical countries; Energy conservation","J.P.

Machine-learning algorithms are non-linear mapping functions to approximate any given function from known input–output pairs and can be used for this purpose. This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN)-based method to predict hybrid wind–solar resources and estimate power generation by correlating wind speed and solar radiation for real-time data. The proposed ANN allows optimization of the hybrid system’s operation by efficient wind and solar energy production estimation for a given set of weather conditions. The proposed model uses temperature, humidity, air pressure, solar radiation, optimum angle, and target values of known wind speeds, solar radiation, and optimum angle. A normalization function to narrow the error distribution and an iterative method with the Levenberg–Marquardt training function is used to reduce error. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the existing wind, solar, or wind–solar estimation methods. It is envisaged that such an intelligent yet simplified method for predicting wind speed, solar radiation, and optimum angle, and designing wind–solar hybrid systems can improve the accuracy and efficiency of renewable energy generation. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial neural network; energy prediction; wind-speed prediction; wind–solar prediction","Electric power distribution; Hybrid systems; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Neural networks; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Wind; Energy prediction; Hybrid wind; Network-based approach; Optimum angle; Radiation angle; Real- time; Solar resource assessments; Wind speed; Wind speed prediction; Wind–solar prediction; Forecasting","I.D.L.T.

With sheer limitless possibilities for material combinations and synthetic procedures, obtaining novel, highly functional materials has been a tedious trial and error process. Recently, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to help optimize syntheses; however, most approaches require a substantial amount of input data, limiting their pertinence. Here, three well-known machine-learning models are merged with Bayesian optimization into one to optimize the synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with limited data demand. The algorithm can accurately predict the photoluminescence emission maxima of nanoplatelet dispersions using only the three precursor ratios as input parameters. This allows us to fabricate previously unobtainable seven and eight monolayer-thick nanoplatelets. Moreover, the algorithm dramatically improves the homogeneity of 2–6-monolayer-thick nanoplatelet dispersions, as evidenced by narrower and more symmetric photoluminescence spectra. Decisively, only 200 total syntheses are required to achieve this vast improvement, highlighting how rapidly material properties can be optimized. The algorithm is highly versatile and can incorporate additional synthetic parameters. Accordingly, it is readily applicable to other less-explored nanocrystal syntheses and can help rapidly identify and improve exciting compositions’ quality. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the PV system may not perform optimally due to its high dependence on climatic conditions, and several methods have been suggested for this reason. To augment a photovoltaic system's output power, constantly following the highest power (MPP) of the system is required. The MPP is influenced by irradiance conditions, the panel’s temperature, and the load coupled. This work describes the use of machine learning to detect the maximum operating point of a photovoltaic installation. This solar generator in turn feeds a pump through a BLDC motor. To show the efficacy of the method, a comparison with a classical method such as perturb and observe, recognized for its simplicity of implementation and rapid track, will be examined. The proposed MPPT technique demonstrated the best results in terms of PV system efficiency and demonstrated the success of the proposed technique.

Randomness in energy production and consumption make both the prediction and optimality of exchanges challenging. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of uncertainties on optimality of different robust energy exchange strategies. To address the problem, we present AIROBE, a data-driven system that uses machine-learning-based predictions of energy supply and demand as input to calculate robust energy exchange schedules using a multiband robust optimization approach to protect from deviations. AIROBE allows the decision maker to tradeoff robustness with stability of the system and energy costs. Our evaluation shows, how AIROBE can deal effectively with asymmetric deviations and how better prediction methods can reduce both the operational cost while at the same time may lead to increased operational stability of the system. © 2023 The Author(s)","Machine learning and AI; Renewable energy; Robust optimization; Smart grid","Decision making; Economics; Forecasting; Machine learning; Optimization; Smart power grids; System stability; Energy exchanges; Machine learning and AI; Machine-learning; Microgrid; Optimality; Renewable energies; Robust energy; Robust optimization; Smart grid; Uncertainty; Energy management","A.

Promising energy storage systems, such as batteries and green hydrogen, should be employed to maximize the efficiency of energy stakeholders. However, optimal decision-making, i.e., planning the leveraging between different strategies, is confronted with the complexity and uncertainties of large-scale problems. A sophisticated deep reinforcement learning methodology with a policy-based algorithm is proposed to achieve real-time optimal energy storage systems planning under the curtailed renewable energy uncertainty. A quantitative performance comparison proved that the deep reinforcement learning agent outperforms the scenario-based stochastic optimization algorithm, even with a wide action and observation space. A robust performance, with maximizing net profit and a stable system, confirmed the uncertainty rejection capability of the deep reinforcement learning under a large uncertainty of the curtailed renewable energy. Action mapping was performed to visually assess the action the deep reinforcement learning agent took according to the state. The corresponding results confirmed that the deep reinforcement learning agent learns how the deterministic solution performs and demonstrates more than 90% profit accuracy compared to the solution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Curtailed renewable energy; Energy management system; Machine learning; Mathematical programming; Process planning; Reinforcement learning","Decision making; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Hydrogen storage; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mathematical programming; Profitability; Robot programming; Curtailed renewable energy; Energy; Hybrid energy storage systems; Machine-learning; Optimal planning; Reinforcement learning agent; Reinforcement learnings; Renewable energies; Storage systems; Uncertainty; algorithm; alternative energy; energy management; energy planning; energy storage; linear programing; machine learning; Reinforcement learning","J.

Inherent variabilities of these power entities introduce uncertainties that affect the economical operations and integrity of the electrical grid. Thus, optimal power flow (OPF) studies must be conducted at high granularity in order to account for these fluctuations. However, due to the non-convex nature of the OPF problem, solving it in real-time still remains an open challenge. In this paper, a novel data-driven approach that combines generative learning, information theory and domain knowledge is proposed to enable real-time OPF studies. In order to train this model, only feasible datapoints are necessary - not optimal values. Once trained, the time required to compute the solution is extremely fast and falls within the sub-second range. No information pertaining to the topology or power flow equations is required once the model is trained. Theoretical guarantees on optimality and feasibility of the solutions generated by the proposed ML model are established. Comprehensive practical and comparative studies conducted demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-driven approach for solving OPF in real-time.  © 2022 IEEE.","Machine learning; optimization; smart grid","Acoustic generators; Climate change; Climate models; Computation theory; Digital storage; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Information theory; Interactive computer systems; Problem solving; Renewable energy resources; Topology; Computational modelling; Fluctuation; Load flow; Load modeling; Optimal power flows; Power grids; Problem-solving; Real - Time system; Real- time; Renewable energy source; Real time systems","J.

This escalation poses a critical challenge for waste management and raises considerable environmental concerns. One pivotal solution is the conversion of this wet waste into valuable energy resources and carbon-neutral mediums, a strategy aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) - Affordable and Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG15) - Life on Land. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and pyrolysis have emerged as effective technologies due to their ability to process large volumes of wet waste and convert it into energy-rich and carbon-stable products with high energy efficiency. This study introduces a novel framework incorporating advanced machine learning techniques (including deep neural networks, random forest, and eXtreme gradient boosting) with dual-objective optimization. This approach enables a comparative analysis of the solid products from HTC and pyrolysis, focusing on their Carbon Stability Index (CSI) and Return on Energy Investment (REI) index. This assessment enables the tailoring of char production towards specific applications, yielding optimal conditions for high energy efficiency and stable carbon sequestration. In a case study involving wet food waste, the analysis indicated a significant enhancement from 4.83 to 14.43 in REI and an increase from 47.4 to 57.98 in CSI compared to conventional HTC solutions. Moreover, the uncertainty analysis demonstrated that our machine learning-based model provides robust and reliable predictions, with most of the R-squared (R2) values exceeding 0.90, meeting or exceeding the R2 values reported in similar ML models of biomass conversion in the literature, reinforcing its potential for practical applications. Our study also plots the solid products in a Van Krevelen diagram, showing composition changes during conversion. These findings exemplify the potential of these processes in bolstering the primary objectives of SDG7 and SDG15, thereby contributing to a more sustainable future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Affordable and clean energy; Carbon sequestration; Hydrothermal carbonization; Machine learning; Pyrolysis; Waste-to-energy conversion","Adaptive boosting; Carbon; Carbonization; Deep neural networks; Energy efficiency; Forestry; Investments; Learning systems; Pyrolysis; Sustainable development; Waste management; Affordable and clean energy; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stability; Clean energy; High energy efficiency; Hydrothermal carbonization; Machine-learning; Solid products; Stability indices; Waste to energy conversion; Uncertainty analysis","F.

However, existing research ignores the implicit features of the data preprocessing technique and the role of the internal mechanism of the optimization algorithm, making it difficult to achieve high-accuracy prediction. To fill this gap, this study proposes a wind speed forecasting model that combines data denoising techniques, optimization algorithms, and machine learning algorithms. The model discusses the important parameters in the data decomposition technique, determines the best parameter values by comparing the model’s performance, and then decomposes and reconstructs the wind speed time series. In addition, a novel optimization algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the machine learning algorithm using a waiting strategy and an aggressive strategy to improve the effectiveness of the model. Several control experiments were designed and implemented using 10-min wind speed data from three sites in Penglai, Shandong Province. Based on the numerical comparison results and the discussion of the proposed model, it is concluded that the developed model can obtain high accuracy and reliability of wind speed prediction in the short term relative to other comparative models and can have further applications in wind power plants. © 2023 by the authors.","egret population optimization algorithm; ensemble model; selection of parameters; wind speed forecasting","Carbon; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Wind speed; Carbon neutrals; Carbon peaks; Egret population optimization algorithm; Ensemble models; High-accuracy; Machine learning algorithms; Model-based OPC; Optimization algorithms; Selection of parameter; Wind speed forecasting; Wind power","A.

High integration of RES especially wind energy into the existing power sector in recent years has made the situation still challenging which draws the attention of many researchers in developing a computationally efficient forecast model for accurately predicting RES. With the advent of Neural network based methods, ELM -Extreme Learning Machine, a typical Single Layer Feedforward Network (SLFFN), has gained a significant attention in recent years in solving various real-time complex problems due to simplified architecture, good generalization capabilities and fast computation. However, since the model parameters are randomly assigned, the conventional ELM is frequently ranked as the second-best model. As a solution, the article attempts to construct a unique optimized Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based forecast model with improved accuracy for wind speed forecasting. A novel swarm intelligence technique- Lévy flight Chaotic Whale Optimization algorithm (LCWOA) is utilized in the hybrid model to optimize different parameters of ELM. Despite having a appropriate convergence rate, WOA is occasionally unable to discover the global optima due to imbalanced exploration and exploitation when using control parameters with linear variation. An improvement in the convergence rate of WOA can be expected by incorporating chaotic maps in the control parameters of WOA due to their ergodic nature. In addition to this, Lévy flight can significantly improve the intensification and diversification of the Whale Optimization algorithm (WOA) resulting in improvised search ability avoiding local minima.

In this study, machine learning tools are used to classify macro-biocolonisation images into four categories: 'mussels', 'barnacles', ‘calcareous worms' and ‘no macro-biocolonisation’ as part of the suspected “most impacting species” of the fluid/Structure behavior of colonized components. A transfer learning approach is investigated using a state-of-the-art convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and an open-source training algorithm is specifically modified to ensure rapid reproducibility of the methodology: image selection, CNN adaptation, training/validation process and quality assessment. A database of 1261 images is set up to train the models; their performances are tested using images of offshore components with and without biocolonisation. Two stochasticity sources were evaluated: coming from the modest size of the data base trough cross validation on 5 folds, and sensitivity to the numerical model through the building of 30 models per fold. The performance was discussed with particular care, given the small number of images available and the statistical uncertainties of the metrics evaluated from the validation process. The average performance of the models on the testing images is 69% of good detection for all classes combined. In engineering point of view the results are satisfactory since the two classes with maximum hydrodynamic impact (mussel and ‘no macro-biocolonisation’) provides average detection of 81% and 79%. Recommendations are proposed to enrich the training image database and photographic surveys on offshore structures, in providing metrics enabling algorithm optimization in engineering purposes. The main innovation of this study is to adapt existing machine learning tools to a new and complex application area: the biofouling. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Computer vision; Marine growth; Marine structure maintenance; Picture survey; Transfer learning","Biofouling; Computer vision; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine components; Offshore oil well production; Convolution neural network; Learning tool; Machine-learning; Marine growth; Marine structure maintenance; Offshore renewable energies; Performance; Picture survey; Transfer learning; Validation process; alternative energy; biofouling; computer vision; image classification; machine learning; marine environment; Image classification","G.

In this context, this work presents a novel approach for optimizing MEMS-based energy scavengers by predicting output power and natural frequency of operation through Synthetic Data and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. For optimization, the work considers a bimorph cantilever-based energy scavenger, which consists of an elastic layer sandwiched between two piezoelectric layers. Various design parameters and their effect on the performance of the energy scavengers were evaluated through different ML models. The exploratory data analysis and preprocessing steps were carried out over the generated data, and subsequently, prediction of frequency and power was performed; 80 % of the data was used for training purposes, and 20 % of the data was used for testing purposes. Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) was observed to be the best among the ML models for predicting frequency and power - with the R2 score of 97 % and 86 %, respectively. The optimized scavenger can generate an output power of 5.06 mW with an output voltage of 11.02 V. This approach can help the researchers by predicting the output power and resonant frequency, opening new research opportunities in the optimization of MEMS-based Energy Scavengers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Cantilever; Energy Scavenger; Machine Learning (ML); Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS); Renewable energy generation; Synthetic data","Forecasting; MEMS; Nanocantilevers; Natural frequencies; Renewable energy resources; Cantilever; Energy scavenger; Machine learning; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Micro-electromechanical system; Optimisations; Output power; Renewable energy generation; Synthetic data; Machine learning","K.

Accurate wind power forecasting is important for the efficient and stable use of wind energy. The erratic stochastic nature of wind power generation and the complexity of the data pose a significant challenge for short-term forecasting. Extracting features from the complex wind power data can improve the prediction models, which is a key issue for short-term forecasting. In this paper, a feature-weighted principal component analysis (WPCA) method and an improved gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network model with optimized hyperparameters using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are proposed. Compared with other good machine learning models, the proposed hybrid WPCA-PSO-GRU model is used to perform power prediction for a real-world wind farm. The results show that the MAE and RMSE of the WPCA-PSO-GRU model are reduced by 5.3%–16% and 10%–16% respectively, and R2 is increased by 2.1%–3.1% compared to the conventional model. The proposed model can reduce the impact of noisy data on model training, randomness, and the volatility of wind power generation.

Plan to develop a better electric system that uses centralized renewable generations, such as solar panels, wind turbines, energy storage devices, and a diesel generator to ensure the reliability of power supply. Our electricity needs must be optimally satisfied by the chosen HRES. A test system is created with a few houses in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to conduct a case study. Further, to increase the system’s reliability, we have probabilistically determined solar irradiance and wind speed using a machine learning technique, i.e., Random Forest. The suggested HRES satisfied the anticipated home load demand of 17.79 kWh/day and peak load of 1.490 Kw. For the energy dispatch of HRES, the optimal economical design of the system is determined based on the Cost of Electricity (COE) and renewable fraction using the proposed TFSO, PSO, AOA, GA, MFA and HOMOR Pro software. The optimal result of COE ₹ 4.21 at renewable fraction 89.04 is obtained using the Proposed TFSO algorithm. After the economic validation of the system using these algorithms, technical validation of the resulting outcome is done using Typhoon HIL real-time simulator, and the result is observed from DSO, where it is found that the voltage and frequency regulation is within its permissible limit.

Measurement-based approaches are commonly employed to identify load model parameters that closely reflect the actual operating conditions. However, these methods typically rely on iterative parameter search processes, which can be time-consuming, particularly when dealing with complex models. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a parameter identification method for the generalized synthetic load model (SLM) using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) technique, with the aim of enhancing computational efficiency. Furthermore, to achieve better alignment with load response curves, a Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm is adopted to train the ELM model. The proposed QPSO-ELM-based SLM parameter identification method is subsequently evaluated using a standard test system. To assess its effectiveness, parameter sensitivity analysis is performed, and simulation results are analyzed. The findings demonstrate that the proposed method yields favorable outcomes, offering improved computation efficiency in load model parameter identification tasks. © 2023 by the authors.","load characteristics; load model parameters; QPSO-ELM","Curve fitting; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Machine learning; Parameter estimation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Swarm intelligence; Learning machines; Load characteristics; Load model parameter; Load modeling; Model parameter identifications; Modeling parameters; Parameter identification methods; Quanta particle swarm optimizations; Quantum particle swarm optimization-extreme learning machine; Synthetic load model; Computational efficiency","Y.

One of the most important challenges in the solar energy field is detecting anomalies in photovoltaic systems. This paper aims to address this by using various machine learning algorithms and regression models to identify internal and external abnormalities in PV components. The goal is to determine which models can most accurately distinguish between normal and abnormal behavior of PV systems. Three different approaches have been investigated for detecting anomalies in solar power plants in India. The first model is based on a physical model, the second on a support vector machine (SVM) regression model, and the third on an SVM classification model. Grey wolf optimizer was used for tuning the hyper model for all models. Our findings will clarify that the SVM classification model is the best model for anomaly identification in solar power plants by classifying inverter states into two categories (normal and fault). © 2023 by the authors.","intelligent grid system; power plant anomalies; PV; solar energy","","H.

This study aims to use a hybrid Bayesian optimization with tree-structured Parzen estimator (BO-TPE) to predict biogas production from real wastewater treatment plant data using deep neural network machine learning (DNN) with optimized hyperparameters. Due to the high number of missing sample measurement records, the data preprocessing process has been performed in three sequential steps: the first step is to remove columns with a high percentage of missing values. The second step concerns removing rows with a high number of missing values. The remaining missing values in the dataset were removed in the third step using the dropna function from Pandas' library. Then, on the remaining data, three normalization techniques (MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, and StandardScaler) were used for 16 relevant features of the anaerobic digestion process (AD) and compared with Non-Normalized data. The RobustScaler technique demonstrated good prediction capabilities of biogas volume produced. The maximum predicted volume was 2236.105 Nm3/d, with the coefficient of determination (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.712, 164.610, and 223.429, respectively. This value remains slightly higher than the actual biogas volume produced in the wastewater treatment plant, which was 2131 Nm3/d. Adopting StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, and Non-Normalized data provided statistical performance indicator values of (0.690; 170.518; 231.519), (0.679; 180.575; 235.648), and (0.647; 183.403; 247.203), respectively. These findings offer an autonomous strategy to monitor the effective operational variables of a large-scale digester, ensuring the stability of the complex fermentation process as well as the long-term sustainability and economic viability of the renewable energy approach in the sector of waste treatment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Deep neural network; Hybrid BO-TPE; Hyperparameters","Anaerobic digestion; Bayesian networks; Biogas; Complex networks; Fermentation; Forecasting; Mean square error; Multilayer neural networks; Network architecture; Process control; Purification; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Trees (mathematics); Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Bayesian optimization; Biogas production; Fermentation process; Hybrid bayesian optimization with tree-structured parzen estimator; Hyper-parameter; Missing values; Non normalized data; Parzen estimators; Tree-structured; Waste water treatment plants; Deep neural networks","R.

Yeltsin, Ekaterinburg, 620002, Russian Federation","At the current stage of the integration of renewable energy sources into the power systems of many countries, requirements for compliance with established technical characteristics are being applied to power generation. One such requirement is the installed capacity utilization factor, which is extremely important for optimally placing power facilities based on renewable energy sources and for the successful development of renewable energy. Efficient placement maximizes the installed capacity utilization factor of a power facility, increasing energy efficiency and the payback period. The installed capacity utilization factor depends on the assumed meteorological factors relating to geographical location and the technical characteristics of power generation. However, the installed capacity utilization factor cannot be accurately predicted, since it is necessary to know the volume of electricity produced by the power facility. A novel approach to the optimization of placement of renewable energy source power plants and their capacity factor forecasting was proposed in this article. This approach combines a machine learning forecasting algorithm (random forest regressor) with a metaheuristic optimization algorithm (grey wolf optimizer). Although the proposed approach assumes the use of only open-source data, the simulations show better results than commonly used algorithms, such as random search, particle swarm optimizer, and firefly algorithm. © 2023 by the authors.","capacity factor; energy optimization; forecasting; grey wolf optimizer; optimization; renewable energy sources","","A.M.

These schemes should be able to cope with the intermittency of uncertain RERs and fully explore the capabilities of new technologies while considering the vulnerabilities as a result of digitalization. Here, the integrity of the energy and flexibility scheduling and trading heavily depends on the security of the cyber-physical system. Local energy networks (LENs) are introduced to easily incorporate and utilize distributed energy resources, improving electrical power reliability and efficiency. This study develops a cyber-secure energy and flexibility scheduling platform for interconnected local energy networks. Hence, it introduces a novel false data detection and correction method based on the XGBoost machine learning method and investigates the performance of the proposed algorithm in the context of an interconnected local energy network and the corresponding energy and flexibility transactions. In this regard, this paper initially presents a bilevel energy and flexibility scheduling problem for interconnected local energy networks (ILENs) considering cyber-attacks (BLEFSCAILEN), which tries to satisfy the energy and flexibility requirements of the ILEN guaranteeing a resilient decision against false data injection cyber-attacks. Within the proposed BLEFSCAILEN a bi-level multi-objective optimization problem is defined where the operator of ILEN optimizes both energy and flexibility trading among LENs in the upper level to maximize its revenue. In the proposed structure, the operator of each LEN is situated at the lower level and tries to minimize the scheduling cost and simultaneously maximize the local flexibility index. Furthermore, in order to evaluate and improve the proposed system's cyber-security, a false data injection attack is constructed using the Gaussian probability distribution function. Herein, the scheduling of ILEN is optimized considering vulnerabilities of electricity consumption data as a consequence of cyber-attack. Finally, the novel XGBoost-assisted deviation bound-based false data detection/correction (XGBFDD) algorithm is suggested to mitigate the above-mentioned cyber-attack and attain near real-world conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed false data detection/correction strategy exhibits a maximum accuracy of 91.67 precent in mitigating the attack effects. This is because the acquired post-correction results exhibit minor deviations in comparison to the original optimization output that is calculated with the pre-attack consumption data. © 2023 The Author(s)","Bi-level Multi-objective Optimization; Cyber-attack; False Data Injection; Flexibility Trading; Interconnected local energy networks; XGBoost Machine Learning Methodology","Commerce; Crime; Cyber attacks; Cyber Physical System; Electric power distribution; Embedded systems; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Network security; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Bi-level multi-objective optimization; Cyber-attacks; Energy networks; False data injection; Flexibility trading; Interconnected local energy network; Local energy; Machine-learning; Multi-objectives optimization; Xgboost machine learning methodology; Distribution functions","A.

Furthermore, in light of the current UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports concerning global warming and the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to constrain global temperature increase to within 1.5–2 °C above pre-industrial levels, urgent sociotechnical measures need to be taken. Together, Smart Microgrid and renewable energy technology have been proposed as a possible solution to help mitigate global warming and grid instability. Within this context, well-managed demand-side flexibility is crucial for efficiently utilising on-site solar energy. To this end, a well-designed dynamic pricing mechanism can organise the actors within such a system to enable the efficient trade of on-site energy, therefore contributing to the decarbonisation and grid security goals alluded to above. However, designing such a mechanism in an economic setting as complex and dynamic as the one above often leads to computationally intractable solutions. To overcome this problem, in this work, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) alongside Foundation – an open-source economic simulation framework built by Salesforce Research – to design a dynamic price policy. By incorporating a peer-to-peer (P2P) community of prosumers with heterogeneous demand/supply profiles and battery storage into Foundation, our results from data-driven simulations show that MARL, when compared with a baseline fixed price signal, can learn a dynamic price signal that achieves both a lower community electricity cost, and a higher community self-sufficiency. Furthermore, emergent social–economic behaviours, such as price elasticity, and community coordination leading to high grid feed-in during periods of overall excess photovoltaic (PV) supply and, conversely, high community trading during overall low PV supply, have also been identified. Our proposed approach can be used by practitioners to aid them in designing P2P energy trading markets. © 2023 The Author(s)","Community-based market; Dynamic pricing; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multi-agent systems; Peer-to-peer market; Proximal Policy Optimisation","Costs; Digital storage; Dynamics; Fertilizers; Multi agent systems; Power markets; Reinforcement learning; Solar energy; Community-based; Community-based market; Dynamic price; Dynamic pricing; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Peer to peer; Peer-to-peer market; Policy optimization; Price signals; Proximal policy optimization; alternative energy; climate change; electricity; energy market; global warming; infrastructure planning; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; machine learning; pricing policy; simulation; Global warming","P.

In this paper, a simulation of a solar desalination plant was performed using the finite element method. A small amount of alumina nanoparticles was added to the salt water in the desalination water. Two-phase method was used for its analysis. By changing the wall height parameters from 5 to 20 cm, the glass angle from 10 to 45° and the ambient temperature from 10 to 55°, the entropy (ENT) values produced in desalination were studied. Thermal ENT, friction ENT and total ENT were studied by changing the parameters and an optimization was done on the parameters to have the lowest ENT production in desalination using machine learning. The results of this study showed that the thermal ENT was greater than the friction ENT in the desalination water. An increase in ambient temperature has reduced some of the ENT production of friction, thermal ENT and total ENT. Increasing the height of the desalination wall has less effect on the ENT production and it can be seen that the increase of the desalination wall height has increased the production of thermal ENT and total ENT, but its further increase has decreased the production of thermal ENT and total ENT. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental consideration; Machine learning; Nanofluid; Numerical method; Solar energy; Water desalination","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Energy utilization; Entropy; Environmental impact; Friction; Machine learning; Nanofluidics; Nanoparticles; Numerical methods; Solar energy; Temperature; Water filtration; % reductions; Alumina Nanoparticle; Desalinated water; Entropy production; Environmental considerations; Machine-learning; Nanofluids; Thermal; Total entropy; Water desalination; Desalination","M.A. Ali; Department of Industrial Engineering, College of Engineering, Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz University, Alkharj, 16273, Saudi Arabia; email: mas.ali@psau.edu.sa","","Elsevier Ltd","09557997","","EABAE","","English","Eng Anal Boundary Elem","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150066738"

However, the random fluctuation characteristics and seasonality of wind and light make them difficult to predict, which brings many operational risks to grid security and power dispatch. Therefore, this paper uses the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) as the decomposition algorithm, which can effectively avoid the problems of modal confusion and noise residuals and better identify the trend, seasonality and nonlinear characteristics of the series. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is also utilized to improve the prediction accuracy and stability of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Combining CEEMDAN and PSO-ELM models, a high-precision hybrid forecasting system that can effectively reduce the effects of stochastic fluctuations is proposed. In this paper, wind speed data from four different seasons at Changma wind farm in China are selected to verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of this hybrid prediction system. The results show that the improvement of ELM by PSO and CEEMDAN significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the model, and the hybrid prediction system can be applied to time series with different data characteristics and variation patterns in each season, and its prediction accuracy and model performance are significantly better than other comparative models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","CEEMDAN; Data processing; Hybrid prediction system; PSO; Renewable energy","Data handling; Electric load dispatching; Energy policy; Forecasting; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Wind power; Wind speed; Adaptive noise; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Hybrid prediction system; Hybrid predictions; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Prediction systems; Renewable energies; Swarm optimization; Empirical mode decomposition","Y.

However, it is unclear how EV charging demand can affect building energy system design while aligning with ZEB requirements. Therefore, this paper develops a new framework to find the optimal energy system design that meets EV charging demand and ZEB requirements. The charging demand for EVs is predicted by the machine learning model, which combines the building energy demand from EnergyPlus. Ultimately, the Genetic Algorithm and PROBID method are applied to optimize the Total Annual Cost (TAC) and Self-Energy Sufficiency Ratio. EV charging demand has been found to affect energy system design, especially in small-size buildings. Using the proposed method, the building owner can determine the optimal capacity of an energy system based on economic and ZEB conditions, contributing to the future net ZEB and transportation systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Energy system optimization; EnergyPlus; Renewable energy; Zero Energy Building","Architectural design; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Structural design; Systems analysis; Zero energy buildings; Building energy systems; Building requirements; Carbon dioxide emissions; Charging demands; Electric vehicle charging; Energy system design; Energy system optimizations; EnergyPlus; Multi objective; Renewable energies; building; carbon dioxide; electric vehicle; electricity; greenhouse gas; machine learning; optimization; Electric vehicles","X.

The electric power system reform also promoted wholesale trading in the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX) spot market. This study explores an effective JEPX spot market price forecasting model that enables PV power suppliers to make informed production decisions and ensure revenue optimization. We found that understanding the net demand (total demand minus PV generation) is crucial for accurate price forecasting, as it allows for a more precise reflection of the gradual evolution of the solar-dominated energy structure of the dynamic electricity demand. We also conducted parameter tests and a comparative analysis of different training loops and periods in the basic form using an artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms. The results indicated that the narrow ANN and SVR models with a linear kernel function and training in the continuous loop method performed better in spot market price forecasting than other model settings.

Pyrolysis has been widely used to convert PW into high-value-added products, especially liquid fuels, in a sustainable manner. However, achieving a high yield of liquid fuel with good quality remains challenging due to the difficulty in optimizing pyrolysis process and synthesizing outstanding catalysts to narrow the product distribution. This work comprehensively reviewed PW pyrolysis from both technical and computational (machine learning modeling) aspects, with a critical discussion of recent challenges to find new insights for improving the conversion efficiency and promoting commercialization. Results indicated that the impacts of various factors, including PW type, process condition, catalyst, and reactor type, on the PW pyrolysis were extensively investigated by the research community. Machine learning methods have also been frequently applied to predict, interpret, and optimize the PW pyrolysis. However, more efforts can be made in the future regarding catalyst synthesis, selection of co-pyrolysis additives, mechanism of catalyst deactivation, and design of renewable energy supply system for PW pyrolysis plants.

The size of the chemical space of PH anions (>106 molecules) has so far limited attempts to explore the full family of candidate molecules. We created a machine learning workflow to speed up the discovery process using full-density functional theory calculations for training the model. The physics-informed machine learning model allowed us to pinpoint promising molecules with a head group that prevents lattice distortion and anti-site defect formation, and a tail group optimized for strong attachment to the surface. We identified 15 potential bifunctional PH anions with the ability to passivate both donors and acceptors, and through experimentation, discovered that sodium thioglycolate was the most effective passivant. This strategy resulted in a power-conversion efficiency of 24.56% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.19 volts (24.04% National Renewable Energy Lab-certified quasi-steady-state) in inverted perovskite solar cells. Encapsulated devices maintained 96% of their initial power-conversion energy during 900 hours of one-sun operation at the maximum power point. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Conversion efficiency; Density functional theory; Negative ions; Open circuit voltage; Passivation; Perovskite; Perovskite solar cells; Sodium compounds; Bi-functional; Chemical space; Deep impurities; Defect passivation; Halide anions; Impurity state; Optimisations; Passivation strategy; Pseudo Halide; Surface passivation; Molecules","E.H.

The reason for this trend is to reduce costs and preserve the environment. However, the challenge is to efficiently use and store the energy from these sources. One approach is to optimize the decision when to charge or discharge a battery. The objective is to generate the greatest monetary gain. More charge/discharge cycles will reduce the life of a battery, thereby increasing the cost. A strategy to reduce the number of charge cycles while maintaining the effectiveness of electricity distribution from battery storage will improve battery life. With the inevitable proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) in the market, strategies specific to electric vehicle battery profitability will be explored. An additional concern which threatens the financial feasibility of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is the requirement of secure operation. There is currently little research study on strategies to detect cyberattacks on such systems. In this paper, we have presented a novel taxonomy for battery optimization, survey representative BESS utilization strategies, and classify these schemes within the taxonomy. Within our classification, we outline the battery optimization methods that have been discussed, analyze their ability to address issues that arise when implementing a BESS, and describe alternative research that could be explored. Future research could refer to this information to create unique battery optimization schemes to provide more efficiency and optimal revenue for a BESS when compared to current strategies.  © 2013 IEEE.","battery management systems; electric vehicles; Energy storage; machine learning; microgrids; renewable energy sources","Battery management systems; Battery storage; Charging (batteries); Cost reduction; Electric discharges; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Learning systems; Natural resources; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery; Battery energy storage systems; Battery optimization; Machine-learning; Microgrid; Optimisations; Renewable energy source; States of charges; Renewable energy resources","I.

The hybridization of these resources has the potential to reduce unpredictability and intermittency while increasing efficiency. The accuracy of size optimization of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) can be improved by using accurate weather data that can be obtained through forecasting. Thus, to increase the precision of the size optimization, hourly forecasting of global horizontal irradiation, temperature, and wind speed for one year has been performed using Gaussian process regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree techniques. The results of all four forecasting models (FM) are then compared and revealed that the results obtained from GPR are better than those of other FM; therefore, the forecasted data for solar, wind, and temperature obtained from GPR are used for sizing the HRES. The net present cost is utilized to analyze the viability of the HRES while considering system reliability. Furthermore, recently developed optimization algorithms, namely the Colony Predation Algorithm (CPA), Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), and Aquila Optimization (AO) algorithms have been applied to the sizing of a grid-connected HRES to meet the energy needs of a remote site in the Indian province of Haryana. A comparison of CPA, AO, and TSA has been carried out and revealed that TSA offers more promising outcomes. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate a 0.42% reduction in per unit cost of energy when forecasted data has been used for size optimization. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Forecasting; Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES); Machine Learning; Optimization techniques; Rural electrification","Decision trees; Fossil fuels; Hybrid systems; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Weather forecasting; Wind; Energy systems; Forecasting models; Gaussian process regression; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy system; Machine-learning; Optimization techniques; Rural electrification; Size optimization; Swarm algorithms; Machine learning","B.

Critically, the development of a renewable energy-dominated electricity market is an important way to achieve global climate goals and energy conversion. Despite improved achievement of electricity demand response (EDR) market, only limited development in the coordination capacity and development scale of EDR are dominated by renewable energy. Moreover, the normal operation and work efficiency of the system is greatly affected due to data transmission errors and other human factors. Thus, it is of great importance for the State Grid to accurately identify the data sources and realize the interactive development of cross-region power systems. This paper presents a new cross-region (province) electricity demand response (CR-EDR) model in China for large-scale renewable energy participating in EDR market. This model is applied to three provinces in China based on renewable energy, and fully consider how wind power is integrated with EDR in terms of operation, grid connection and optimization. Presently, China is in the initial stage of development, and the identification of data anomalies is inevitable for the CR-EDR. To solve this problem, a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach is proposed for effective identification of EDR. By calculating wind power output and customers’ EDR results, reliable feature sequences can be obtained. Finally, all the feature sequences are uploaded to cross-region system operators (CR-SO) for classification and identification by ML. In the case studies and discussions, we integrated all feature sequences to CR-SO for identification and present a novel process approach to implement EDR, the random forest (RF) enables 100% accuracy for training set and 99.7685% for testing set with small training samples. Compared with RF, support vector machine only achieves 79.1667% for testing set with small training samples. With accurate RF identification results, the stable operation capability and management level of the system can be effectively improved. The proposed methodology creates a new provincial perspective of China and the establishment of CR-EDR, which provides a theoretical and methodological guidance for all countries and regions to develop CR-EDR. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Coupled wind-storage integrated systems; Cross-region (province) electricity demand response; Data identification; Large-scale renewable energy; Machine learning-based approach","China; Commerce; Data integration; Digital storage; Electric power transmission; Electric power utilization; Integrated control; Sampling; Support vector machines; Coupled wind-storage integrated system; Cross-region (province) electricity demand response; Data identification; Electricity demand response; Integrated systems; Large-scale renewable energy; Large-scales; Learning-based approach; Machine learning-based approach; Machine-learning; Renewable energies; alternative energy; data transmission; demand analysis; energy conservation; energy market; energy storage; machine learning; support vector machine; wind power; Wind power","T.

These techniques involve multiple agents that respond to a dynamic simulation environment to strategically integrate EV charging stations (EVCSs) on microgrids by incorporating the constraints posed by stochastic trip durations. In addition, recent research works have demonstrated that planning frameworks based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) techniques are suitable for the efficient functioning of microgrids comprising renewable energy sources (RESs) and battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Even though MADRL techniques have been used to solve the optimum EV charging scheduling challenges and MOO frameworks have been developed to determine the optimal RES-BESS allocation, the potential of merging MADRL and MOO is yet to be explored. Therefore, this research provides an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of combined MOO-MADRL dynamics and their computational efficacy. In this context, this work presents a novel Multi-objective Artificial Vultures Optimization Algorithm based on Multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MOAVOA-MADDPG) planning framework for allocating RESs, BESSs, and EVCSs on microgrids. The objective function is formulated to optimize the network power losses, total installation and operational costs, greenhouse gas emissions, and system voltage stability. Moreover, the proposed framework incorporates the sporadic nature of RES systems and intends to improve the state of charge (SOC) of the EVs present in the network. The presented approach is validated using practical weather data and EV commuting behavior on the modified IEEE 33 bus network, two practical distribution feeders in Bangladesh, and the Turkish 141 bus network. According to the findings, the MOAVOA-MADDPG framework effectively accommodated the financial, technical, and environmental considerations with improved average SOC of the vehicles. Furthermore, statistical analysis, spacing, convergence, and hyper-volume metrics are employed to compare the suggested MOAVOA-MADDPG framework with five contemporary techniques. The findings indicate that, in every metric considered, the MOAVOA-MADDPG Pareto fronts provide superior solutions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Electric vehicle; Microgrid; Optimization; Reinforcement learning","Bangladesh; Charging (batteries); Deep learning; Digital storage; Electric power distribution; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Multi agent systems; Multiobjective optimization; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Deep learning; Deterministics; Microgrid; Multi agent; Multi objective; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Reinforcement learnings; Renewable energy source; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy planning; energy resource; energy storage; greenhouse gas; machine learning; optimization; smart grid; Reinforcement learning","H.J.

Although MPCMs provide thermal energy storage capability in concrete, they typically decrease its compressive strength. A unified framework for the mixture design of concrete incorporating MPCM is yet to be developed to facilitate practical applications. This study proposes a mix design procedure using a novel ternary machine learning (ML) paradigm. For this purpose, the tabular generative adversarial network (TGAN) was utilized to generate large synthetic mixture design data based on the limited available experimental observations. The synthetic data is then employed to construct robust predictive ML models. The gradient boosting regressor (GBR) model trained with synthetic data outperformed the model trained with real data, achieving a testing coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.963 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.085 MPa. The TGAN-GBR model was ultimately integrated with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to construct a powerful recommendation system for optimizing the mixture design of concrete and mortar incorporating different types of MPCMs. Extensive parametric analyses along with the employed optimization procedure accomplished the mixture design of latent heat thermal energy storage concrete with maximum MPCM inclusion and minimum cement content for various compressive strength classes. The proposed framework enables energy conservation technology in the design of eco-friendly building materials with acceptable mechanical performance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Compressive strength; Concrete; Generative adversarial network; Gradient boosting; Microencapsulated phase change materials; Particle swarm optimization","Concrete mixtures; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Heat storage; Machine learning; Microencapsulation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Phase change materials; Thermal energy; Clean energy; Concrete; Gradient boosting; Machine learning approaches; Microencapsulated phase change material; Mixture design; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Swarm optimization; Synthetic data; Compressive strength","M.L.

However, the growth of decentralized energy production is revealing an increased complexity for power grid managers, inferring more quality and reliability to regulate electricity flows and less imbalance between electricity production and demand. The major objective of an energy management system is to achieve optimum energy procurement and utilization throughout the organization, minimize energy costs without affecting production, and minimize environmental effects. Modern energy management is an essential and complex subject because of the excessive consumption in residential buildings, which necessitates energy optimization and increased user comfort. To address the issue of energy management, many researchers have developed various frameworks; while the objective of each framework was to sustain a balance between user comfort and energy consumption, this problem hasn’t been fully solved because of how difficult it is to solve it. An inclusive and Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS) aims to provide overall energy efficiency regarding increased power generation, increase flexibility, increase renewable generation systems, improve energy consumption, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, improve stability, and reduce energy costs. Machine Learning (ML) is an emerging approach that may be beneficial to predict energy efficiency in a better way with the assistance of the Internet of Energy (IoE) network. The IoE network is playing a vital role in the energy sector for collecting effective data and usage, resulting in smart resource management. In this research work, an IEMS is proposed for Smart Cities (SC) using the ML technique to better resolve the energy management problem. The proposed system minimized the energy consumption with its intelligent nature and provided better outcomes than the previous approaches in terms of 92.11% accuracy, and 7.89% miss-rate. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

Considering the ecological assessment, urban and rural telecommunication infrastructure is moving toward deploying green cellular base stations to cater to the needs of the ever-growing traffic demands of heterogeneous networks. In such scenarios, the existing learning-based renewable resource provisioning methods lack intelligent and optimal resource management at the small cell base stations (SCBS). Therefore, in this article, we present a novel machine learning-based framework for intelligent resource provisioning mechanisms for micro-grid connected green SCBSs with a completely modified ring parametric distribution method. In addition, an algorithmic implementation is proposed for prediction-based renewable resource re-distribution with energy flow control unit mechanism for grid-connected SCBS, eliminating the need for centralized hardware. Moreover, this modeling enables the prediction mechanism to estimate the future on-demand traffic provisioning capability of SCBS.

In recent years, some countries have set renewables to meet future energy needs, with the primary goal of reducing emissions and promoting sustainable growth, primarily the use of wind and solar power. To achieve the prediction of wind power generation, several deep and machine learning models are constructed in this article as base models. These regression models are Deep neural network (DNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) regressor, long short-term memory (LSTM), averaging model, random forest (RF) regressor, bagging regressor, and gradient boosting (GB) regressor. In addition, data cleaning and data preprocessing were performed to the data. The dataset used in this study includes 4 features and 50530 instances. To accurately predict the wind power values, we propose in this paper a new optimization technique based on stochastic fractal search and particle swarm optimization (SFS-PSO) to optimize the parameters of LSTM network. Five evaluation criteria were utilized to estimate the efficiency of the regression models, namely, mean absolute error (MAE), Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean square error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE).

As a case study, we propose a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for a hospital in the south-east of England. Electrical consumption data were gathered from five wards in the hospital for a period of one year. PV-battery-grid system architecture was selected to ensure practical execution through the installation of PV arrays on the roof of the facility. Selection of the optimal system was conducted through a novel methodology combining multi-objective optimisation and data forecasting. The optimisation was conducted using a genetic algorithm with two objectives (1) minimisation of the levelised cost of energy and (2) CO2 emissions. Advanced data forecasting was used to forecast grid emissions and other cost parameters at two year intervals (2023 and 2025). Several optimisation simulations were carried out using the actual and forecasted parameters to improve decision making. The results show that incorporating forecasted parameters into the optimisation allows to identify the subset of optimal solutions that will become sub-optimal in the future and, therefore, should be avoided. Finally, a framework for choosing the most suitable subset of optimal solutions was presented. © 2021 by the authors.","CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Forecasting; Grid-connected; Hospital; Hybrid renewable energy systems; Machine learning; Multi-objective optimisation; Net-zero systems; NHS","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Hospitals; Machine learning; Optimal systems; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Case-studies; CO 2 emission; Grid-connected; Hybrid renewable energies; Hybrid renewable energy system; Multi-objectives optimization; Net-zero system; NHS; Optimal solutions; Optimisations; Multiobjective optimization","F.

Due to the complex and non-linear behaviours during operation, catalytic chemical processes require a powerful modelling tool for prediction and optimisation for smart operation, speedy green process routes discovery and rapid process design. However, challenges remain due to the lack of an effective modelling and optimisation toolbox, which requires not only a precise analysis but also a fast optimisation. Here, we propose a hybrid machine learning strategy by embedding the physics-based continuum lumping kinetic model into the data-driven artificial neural network framework. This hybrid model is adopted as the surrogate model in the multi-objective optimisation and demonstrated in the benchmarking of a hydrocracking process. The results show that the novel hybrid surrogate model exhibits the mean square error less than 0.01 by comparing with the physics-based simulation results. This well-trained hybrid model was then integrated with non-dominated-sort genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) as the surrogate model to evaluate and optimise the yield and selectivity of the hydrocracking process. The Pareto front from the multi-objective optimisation was able to identify the trade-off curve between the objective functions which is essential for the decision-making during process design. Our work indicates that adopting the hybrid machine learning strategy as the surrogate model in the multi-objective optimisation is a promising approach in various complex catalytic chemical processes to enable an accurate computation as well as a rapid optimisation. © 2021 The Author(s)","Catalytic chemical process; Hybrid machine learning; Hybrid surrogate model; Multi-objective optimisation","Complex networks; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Process design; Catalytic chemical process; Catalytic process; Chemical process; Hybrid machine learning; Hybrid model; Hybrid surrogate model; Learning strategy; Multi-objectives optimization; Renewable energies; Surrogate modeling; Mean square error","R.

Subsequently, the time function term is originally designed to incorporate into the dynamic structure to reflect the cumulative time effects, which can smoothly describe the dynamic changes and significantly improve the robustness of the novel model. Further, the self-adaptive parameters optimized using particle swarm optimization can effectively enhance the adaptability and generalization of the proposed model.

In this work, Tween 20 and sodium chloride are selected as a model system to reveal the effects of surfactants on salt crystallization in the context of ionic conductivity and interface optimization. At a varied crystallization speed and mix ratio, it is demonstrated that the resultant solution-grown ionic crystalline complexes can achieve a highly tunable ion transport with a controllable crystalline interface. X-ray diffraction results rule out the possibility of polymorphism in the NaCl/Tween 20 systems, which further supports the importance of an optimized crystalline network for optimizing permittivity or ionic conductivity. Raman mapping and machine learning techniques are used to perform semantic segmentation on highly heterogeneous NaCl/Tween 20 complexes. Furthermore, FTIR measurements demonstrate that inter- and intra-molecular interactions play critical roles in the formation of these crystals.

However, such large-scale energy transitions pose a great challenge to power systems due to the volatility of RE. Meanwhile, power demand is increasing over time and it shows temporal characteristics, such as seasonal and peak-valley patterns. Whether the future power system with a larger proportion of RE can meet the surging but fluctuated electricity demand remains problematic. Previous studies on short-term load forecasting focused more on forecasting accuracy than stability. Further, there is a relative paucity of research into temporal patterns. In order to fill in these research gaps, this paper proposes a fuzzy theory-based machine learning model for workdays and weekends short-term load forecasting. Fuzzy time series (FTS) is applied for data mining and back propagation (BP) neural network is used as the main predictor for short-term load forecasting. To exploit the trade-offs between forecasting stability and accuracy, multi-objective optimization is applied to modify the parameters of BP. Moreover, an interval forecasting architecture with several statistical tests is constructed to address forecasting uncertainties. Short-term load data from Victoria in Australia is selected as a case study. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly boost forecasting stability and accuracy, and help strategy making in the field of energy and electricity system management and planning. © 2021 The Author","Fuzzy time series; Multi-objective optimization; Short-term load forecasting; Workdays and weekends","Backpropagation; Data mining; Economic and social effects; Electric power plant loads; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Time series; Environmental risks; Fossil resources; Fuzzy theory; Fuzzy time series; Machine learning methods; Multi-objectives optimization; Power; Renewable energies; Short term load forecasting; Workday and weekend; Forecasting","","","Elsevier Ltd","03787788","","ENEBD","","English","Energy Build.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110478691"

Conventional maximum power point tracking algorithms fail to track the global maximum power point, and global optimization algorithms do not provide global maximum power point in real-time mode due to a slow convergence process.

We tune the modified fuzzy neural net based on modified multi-dimension particle swarm optimization.

Therefore, a two-stage optimal training method of extreme learning machine (ELM) network parameters based on natural evolution strategy (NES) and an improved model of renewable energy power forecasting are proposed. In the first stage, random parameters and the generalized matrix inverse operation process of ELM are used to train the model network parameters. Due to the randomness of the ELM training process and the lack of fine-tuning for parameters in the matrix inverse operation process, the accuracy is deficient although the training speed of the model is fast. Therefore, in the second stage, based on the training results of the original model, the output layer bias and adaptive NES algorithm are introduced to optimize and adjust the network parameters for the second time.

However, existing forecasting algorithms only focused on reducing forecasting errors without considering error compensability by using a large-scale battery. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy called error compensable forecasting. We switch the objective of forecasting from reducing errors to making errors compensable by leveraging a battery, which in turn reduces the dispatched error, the difference between forecasted value and dispatched value. The challenging part of the proposed objective lies in that the stored energy at current time is affected by the previous forecasting result. In this regard, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based error compensable forecasting framework, called DeepComp, having forecasting in the loop of control. This makes an action as a continuous forecasted value, which requires a continuous action space. We leverage proximal policy optimization, which is simple to implement with outstanding performance for continuous control. Extensive experiments with solar and wind power generations show that DeepComp outperforms the conventional forecasting methods by up to 90% and achieves accurate forecasting, e.g., 0.58–1.22% of the mean absolute percentage error. © 2021","Battery control; Deep reinforcement learning; Error compensation; Proximal policy optimization; Renewable energy forecasting","Climate change; Electric batteries; Electric power transmission networks; Error compensation; Forecasting; Reinforcement learning; Wind power; Battery control; Energy error; Forecasting algorithm; Power grids; Power system operations; Proximal policy optimization; Reinforcement learnings; Renewable energies; Renewable energy forecasting; Renewable generation; algorithm; alternative energy; error analysis; forecasting method; machine learning; Deep learning","H.

Most conventional applications of renewable energy are being phased out in order to reduce costs and save the environment. PV plants undergo numerous failures in faults detection and ultimate power developments. These consequences demonstrate in the environmental field and internal components. Even when internal standards are followed, the faults are unavoidable and undetectable. Due to this, the performance of manufacturing plants are not predictable. As a result, a proper fault detection mechanism is required for a PV system to detect faults and avoid energy losses. To address these issues, this research work proposed Internet of Things (IoT) sensor-based fault identification in a solar PV system. The PV panel status is monitored using pressure, light intensity, voltage, and current sensors. These sensor data's are stored in the cloud for further analysis using a web-based control server. To classify the sensor data, models of Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are utilized. The experimental results indicate that ELM achieves a classification accuracy of 96.32%. Which is higher than SVM and other optimization control techniques. The proposed model uses the IoT cloud to provide real-time monitoring and fault detection in plant environmental and electrical parameters.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

Solving the full optimization models for load shedding is computational burdensome and thus slow react to the intense system variations from the increasing renewable energy sources and the more active demand-side behavior. Other sensitivity-based methods impair the control accuracy and may not guarantee global optimality. Artificial intelligence methods, as the data-driven approaches, have recently been well-recognized for its real-time decision-making capability to tackle the system variations. The existing artificial intelligence methods for emergency load shedding are based on shallow learning algorithms and can lead to both load under-cutting and over-cutting events. However, when the loads are under-cut, the power system will be exposed to a high risk of post-control instability that can propagate into cascading events, which incurs significantly higher cost than an over-cutting event. Being aware of such unbalanced control costs, this paper proposes a risk-averse deep learning method for real-time emergency load shedding, which trains deep neural network towards the reluctance to load under-cutting events, so as to avoid the huge control cost incurred by control failure. The case studies on two renewable power systems demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed risk-averse method can significantly improve the control success rate with negligible increase in prediction error, ending up with lower overall control cost. The results verify the enhanced control performance and the practical values of the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Emergency load shedding; Extended equal-area criterion; Power system stability; Renewable energy; Risk-averse learning","Decision making; Deep neural networks; Electric power plant loads; Electric power system control; Electric power system stability; Learning algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Transients; Control costs; Deep learning; Emergency load shedding; Extended equal area criterion; Load-shedding; Power systems stability; Real- time; Renewable energies; Risk averse; Risk-averse learning; alternative energy; artificial intelligence; instability; machine learning; optimization; risk factor; Electric load shedding","Y.

Firstly, the electrical load historical forecast errors are fitted with the normal distribution to construct the load historical intervals. Next, the load history interval and the historical previous 24h, 2h and 1h powers are taken as the model inputs. Then, the random initial population of the ALO is considered to affect the speed and quality of the solution, and the GWO is used to generate a high-quality initial population of the ALO to avoid falling into the local optimal solutions. Furthermore, the ALO is used to optimize the ELM input weights and hide the layer bias to construct an ELM short-term electrical load interval prediction model with the strong generalization capability. Finally, the proposed method is validated by using the electrical loads of a certain city in Hunan province, and the accuracy of the proposed method is proved higher and the quality of the predicted intervals is better by comparing various methods.

Thus, urban planners and designers should employ solar energy analysis as a requirement to propose efficient solutions. This research aims to determine the maximum annual solar radiation with the least volume in various patterns of urban blocks and convert solar radiation modeling and analysis from simulation to emulation for types of urban blocks. As a result, simulation approaches such as Multi-Objective Optimization and Artificial Neural Networking were presented to characterize the influence of different urban scales on solar access and reach the optimal dimensions of the block. In Kermanshah, different patterns of urban blocks were investigated for the study on the urban block scale. The height, direction, number of plots, and scales impact access solar radiation energy and optimize the block's dimensions. A study of 34 different urban blocks found that the ideal size is roughly 100∗100 m, while the best height is between 10 and 15 meters. Furthermore, the findings of predicting the data training models revealed that three outputs, the rate of solar radiation absorption, volume, and area of the urban block, can be predicted with an R2 score of 98% using the research input variables. Thus, radiation absorption estimations utilizing AI algorithms can ultimately replace traditional approaches and time-consuming large-scale energy estimates. The ANN methodology outperforms other machine learning techniques in predicting the objective function, which contains the amount of solar radiation absorption, volume, and surface area, according to the results of this research. Also, this research demonstrates how a simulation technique based on NSGA-II and ANN algorithms may drastically decrease computation time and costs while predicting optimum states prior to getting a real sample. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network; Genetic algorithm optimization; Pareto front; Solar radiation; Urban block","Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Solar energy; Energy analysis; Genetic-algorithm optimizations; Minimum volumes; Multi-objectives optimization; Pareto front; Radiation absorption; Renewable energies; Urban blocks; Urban designers; Urban planners; Solar radiation","O.

Most existing dynamic dispatch schemes depend heavily on explicit forecast or mathematical models of the future uncertainties. Due to the randomness of renewable energy generation and energy demands, these approaches are limited by the accuracy of forecasting or model. A novel model-free dynamic dispatch strategy for IES based on improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to solve the problem. The IES dynamic dispatch problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), in which the uncertainties of renewable generation, electric load and heat load are considered. For solving the MDP, an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm using prioritized experience replay mechanism and L2 regularization is developed, so as to improve the policy quality and learning efficiency of the dispatch strategy. The proposed approach does not require any forecast information or distribution knowledge, and can adaptively respond to the stochastic fluctuations of the supply and demands. Simulation results show the proposed dispatch strategy has faster convergence and lower operating costs than original DDPG-based strategy. In addition, the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of cost-effectiveness and stochastic environmental adaptation are validated. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Deep reinforcement learning; Dynamic energy dispatch; Improved deep deterministic policy gradient; Integrated energy system; Uncertainties","Cost effectiveness; Electric load dispatching; Forecasting; Markov processes; Operating costs; Reinforcement learning; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic systems; Deterministics; Dispatch strategy; Dynamic dispatch; Dynamic energy; Dynamic energy dispatch; Improved deep deterministic policy gradient; Integrated energy systems; Markov Decision Processes; Reinforcement learnings; Uncertainty; algorithm; alternative energy; energy policy; machine learning; optimization; Deep learning","L.

This paper proposes a new comprehensive LCSA model to be integrated into the design process of new buildings and energy refurbishment scenarios of existing ones. The proposed model consists of sets of mathematic equations to describe LCSA pillars of buildings, including Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC), and Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) as the intermediate indices. A final LCSA index is then provided to describe a design scenario's performance from an LCSA perspective using the authors' new formulation and weighting method. The model is also integrated into the optimization process and enhanced with Machine Learning (ML) methods to accelerate the design-assessment process while preserving its accuracy. Finally, given the transition towards buildings' electrification by Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), as a supportive technology, the size-optimization of a residential building's short-term thermal and electrical Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) is chosen to demonstrate the model's capabilities.

Wind power is one of the most important green and renewable energy resources. The estimation of wind energy generation is a critical task that has received wide attention in recent years. Different machine learning models have been developed for this task. In this paper, we present an efficient forecasting model using naturally inspired optimization algorithms. We present an optimized dendritic neural regression (DNR) model for wind energy prediction. A new variant of the seagull optimization algorithm (SOA) is developed using the search operators of the Aquila optimizer (AO). The main idea is to apply the operators of the AO as a local search in the traditional SOA, which boosts the SOA’s search capability. The new method, called SOAAO, is employed to train and optimize the DNR parameters. We used four wind speed datasets to assess the performance of the presented time-series prediction model, called DNR-SOAAO, using different performance indicators. We also assessed the quality of the SOAAO with extensive comparisons to the original versions of the SOA and AO, as well as several other optimization methods. The developed model achieved excellent results in the evaluation. For example, the SOAAO achieved high (Formula presented.) results of 0.95, 0.96, 0.95, and 0.91 on the four datasets. © 2022 by the authors.","Aquila optimizer; dendritic neural regression (DNR); forecasting; metaheuristic; seagull optimization algorithm; time series; wind power","Optimization; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Wind speed; Aquila optimizer; Dendritic neural regression; Dendritics; Metaheuristic; Neural modelling; Optimization algorithms; Optimizers; Seagull optimization algorithm; Times series; Wind power forecasting; Time series","M.A.A.

However, the production of bio-oil with high yield and preferable properties such as low nitrogen content (N_oil) is time/labor-consuming using the traditional HTL experimental method. To this context, machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to aid the bio-oil production with the consideration of related factors in HTL, including biochemical and elemental compositions of biomass, process parameters, and solvents. Results showed that the random forest (RF) algorithm was the best one (average R2 = 0.80) for the multi-task prediction of bio-oil yield (Yield_oil), N_oil, and energy recovery (ER_oil), hence employed for post feature interpretation and optimization. Feature importance indicates that both Yield_oil and ER_oil follow the trend of lipid content in biomass > temperature > retention time, while N_oil follows the trend of N content in biomass > temperature > retention time. Then ML-based optimization was conducted to guide the experimental research to produce bio-oil with high yield and low N content. The HTL experiment verification based on the optimal solutions from the ML-based Particle Swarm Optimization achieved the maximum Yield_oil (54.30%) and minimal N_oil (2.60%) from model biomass (composed of protein content 28%, lipid 48%, and carbohydrates 21%) at 300 °C and 30 min. The experiment verification was successful as the results were comparable to the modeling results, with errors of less than 7% for Yield_oil and ER_oil, and 23% for N_oil, and the N_oil of the experiment N_oil (2.60%) was interestingly lower than the modeled one (3.37%). This work provides new insight and strategy to accelerate the engineered HTL for desired bio-oil production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biocrude oil; Data-driven; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Nitrogen migration; Prediction and optimization; Sub-/super-critical water","Biomass; Decision trees; Fertilizers; Liquefaction; Machine learning; Oils and fats; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Bio-oils; Biocrude oil; Data driven; Experiment verification; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Machine-learning; Nitrogen migration; Oil-production; Prediction and optimization; Sub-/super-critical water; Nitrogen","X.

Major challenges, related to load balancing and grid stability, emerge when a high percentage of energy is provided by renewables. These can be tackled by new energy management strategies guided by power forecasts. This paper presents a data-driven and contextual optimisation forecasting (DCF) algorithm for solar irradiance that was comprehensively validated using short- and long-term predictions, in three US cities: Denver, Boston, and Seattle. Moreover, step-by-step implementation guidelines to follow and reproduce the results were proposed. Initially, a comparative study of two machine learning (ML) algorithms, the support vector machine (SVM) and Facebook Prophet (FBP) for solar prediction was conducted. The short-term SVM outperformed the FBP model for the 1- and 2- hour prediction, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 91.2% in Boston. However, FBP displayed sustained performance for increasing the forecast horizon and yielded better results for 3-hour and long-term forecasts. The algorithms were optimised by further contextual model adjustments which resulted in substantially improved performance. Thus, DCF utilised SVM for short-term and FBP for long-term predictions and optimised their performance using contextual information. DCF achieved consistent performance for the three cities and for long- and short-term predictions, with an average R2 of 85%. © 2021 by the authors.

Firstly, considering the security operation constraints and economic optimization objectives of the transmission and distribution network, the location and capacity determination models of the transmission and distribution network are established respectively. Then, the nonconvex constraint of the second-order cone relaxation transformation model is introduced to establish the location and capacity optimization model of energy storage system considering transmission and distribution integration based on the second-order cone relaxation. Secondly, considering the coordinated operation mechanism of transmission and distribution grids, the locational marginal price of transmission grid with second-order cone constraint is derived. Then, the state representation model of transmission and distribution grids based on ELM is constructed to realize the fast response of states for transmission and distribution grids. Thirdly, the collaborative optimization algorithm for location and capacity determination of energy storage system considering transmission and distribution integration based on ELM is proposed, so as to obtain the global optimal allocation of energy storage system in transmission and distribution grids. Finally, taking a T6D7D9 system as an example for simulation analysis, simulative results show that the proposed strategy can fully coordinate the resources of transmission and distribution grids, promote the safe consumption of clean energy, improve the operation economy of transmission and distribution grids effectively, and achieve the goal of ""mutual benefit"". © 2022, Electric Power Automation Equipment Press.

A new type of sharing economy is emerging with the sharing of energy resources to reduce transaction costs by using platform services in the cloud. Given the obstacles posed by the legacy system and various forms of renewable energy integration, Distributed Energy and Micro Grids (DE-MG) are an efficient means of raising the quality of energy services. Rules for microgrid scalability, maintaining a budget, and security can make this difficult. Consumers are better at receiving the best renewable energy allotment price using a cloud-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network. The main objective is to lower the daily energy cost of microgrid power in commercial buildings. In the proposed work, cloud-based P2P for peer-Multi Agent System (p-MAS) optimization techniques are used to reduce system peak and integrated Demand Response (DR) with Energy Management System (EMS) in a commercial MG. To fill knowledge gaps about how various power market architectures and individual decision-making processes impact local interactions and market outcomes, cloud-based P2P for Modelling Leveraging Agents (MLA) is used for bill calculation. A performance measure is finally created for cost evaluation and reliability to measure the social benefits of cloud-based P2P models for exchanging energy. For various price environments and resource types, a comparison between the proposed cloud-based P2P model with an existing P2P model for exchanging energy is provided. The primary use of a distributed P2P model for exchanging power in a microgrid is to reduce electricity costs and increase grid environment reliability. © 2023 The Authors.

Precise forecasting of wind power generation is crucial to mitigate the challenges of balancing supply and demand in the smart grid. Nevertheless, the major difficulty in wind power is its high fluctuation and intermittent nature, making it challenging to forecast. This study aims to develop efficient data-driven models to accurately forecast wind power generation. Crucially, the main contributions of this work are listed in the following major elements. Firstly, we investigate the performance of enhanced machine learning models to forecast univariate wind power time-series data. Specifically, we employed Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimally tune hyperparameters of the Gaussian process regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) with different kernels, and ensemble learning (ES) models (i.e., Boosted trees and Bagged trees) and investigated their forecasting performance. Secondly, dynamic information has been incorporated in their construction to further enhance the forecasting performance of the investigated models. Specifically, we introduce lagged measurements to enable capturing time evolution into the design of the considered models. Furthermore, more input variables (e.g., wind speed and wind direction) are used to further improve wind prediction performance. Actual measurements from three wind turbines in France, Turkey, and Kaggle are used to verify the efficiency of the considered models. The results reveal the benefit of considering lagged data and input variables to better forecast wind power. The results also showed that the optimized GPR and ensemble models outperformed the other machine learning models. © 2022 by the authors.

A way to offset a change in the nature of hybrid renewable energy immediately is to utilize energy storage without needing to turn on other plants. Photovoltaic panels, a wind turbine, and a wallbox unit (responsible for providing the vehicle’s electrical need) are the components of the proposed system; in addition to being a power source, batteries also serve as a storage unit. Taking advantage of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks, and this new system will take advantage of recent advances in machine learning. By employing algorithms for deep Q-learning, the agent learns from the data of the various elements of the system to create the optimal policy for enhancing performance. To increase the learning efficiency, the reward function is implemented using a fuzzy Mamdani system.

Photovoltaics (PV) is the most popular renewable energy source because the sun is ubiquitous. However, PV's power transfer efficiency varies with different load's electrical characteristics, temperatures on PV panels, and insolation conditions. Based on these factors, Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is a mechanism formulated as an optimization problem adjusting the PV to deliver the maximum power to the load. Under full insolation conditions, varying solar panel temperatures, and different loads MPPT problem is a convex optimization problem. However, when the PV's surface is partially shaded, multiple power peaks are created in the power versus voltage (P-V) curve making MPPT non-convex. Unfortunately, all optimization strategies for MPPT under partial shading applied in previous works, from traditional techniques to Machine Learning and the recently proposed Nature-inspired algorithms, were either computationally expensive or/and led to extensive power losses. To this end, this work presents an algorithm that builds upon metaheuristic optimization algorithms to reduce their complexity further and mitigate the power losses during power tracking. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm converges faster to maximum power point with lower power losses during tracking compared to two very recently proposed MPPT algorithms under partial shading conditions. © 2013 IEEE.","improved limited search strategy (iLSS); maximum power point tracking (MPPT); Metaheuristic algorithms; partial shading (PS); photovoltaic (PV)","Biomimetics; Convex optimization; Energy policy; Incident solar radiation; Maximum power point trackers; Natural resources; Renewable energy resources; Solar cells; Solar power generation; Space research; Supervised learning; Improved limited search strategy; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Partial shading; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaics; Renewable energy source; Search strategies; Energy transfer","Y.

Among all renewable energy sources, wind energy is the most developed technology across the world. To ensure the profitability of wind turbines, it is essential to develop predictive maintenance strategies that will optimize energy production while preventing unexpected downtimes. With the huge amount of data collected every day, machine learning is seen as a key enabling approach for predictive maintenance of wind turbines. However, most of the effort is put into the optimization of the model architectures and its parameters, whereas data-related aspects are often neglected. The goal of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of wind turbines through a data-centric machine learning methodology. In particular, we focus on the optimization of data preprocessing and feature selection steps of the machine learning pipeline. The proposed methodology is used to detect failures affecting five components on a wind farm composed of five turbines. Despite the simplicity of the used machine learning model (a decision tree), the methodology outperformed model-centric approach by improving the prediction of the remaining useful life of the wind farm, making it more reliable and contributing to the global efforts towards tackling climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

Knowing the wind power generation within a specific time window is useful for facilitating decision making in terms of maintenance, electricity market clearing, and reload sharing. However, the effect of climatic and demographic factors on wind power generation sometimes makes time series forecasting a complex task. Thus, this study evaluates an ensemble learning model that combines bagging and stacking methods applied to time series forecasting with very short-term (10 and 30-minutes) and short-term (60 and 120-minutes) evaluations of wind power generation. Arithmetic and weighted average values were used to integrate the samples from bagging strategy. The weights are defined through multi-objective optimization using a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm – version II, aiming to enhance the forecasting accuracy and stability simultaneously. To demonstrate the wide applicability of the non-linear ensemble learning model, it is extensively tested with measurement data collected from two wind farms in Bahia State, Brazil. The experimental results show that the proposed ensemble learning model achieves a better forecasting performance than single forecasting models, such as stacking, machine learning, artificial neural networks, and statistical models, with values of approximately 7.63%, 7.58%, 20.8%, and 25%, respectively, in terms of the errors for out-of-sample forecasting reduction. In addition, results with a weighted average are 87.5% superior to those with an arithmetic average for out-of-sample wind power forecasting in the evaluated forecasting horizons. The findings show that the integration of ensemble strategies can provide accurate forecasting results in the renewable energy field. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bagging method; Ensemble learning models; Stacking; Time series forecasting; Wind power generation","Decision making; Electric power generation; Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Time series; Wind power; Bagging method; Ensemble learning; Ensemble learning model; Learning models; Specific time; Stackings; Time series forecasting; Time windows; Weighted averages; Wind power generation; Learning systems","M.H.D.M.

Constructing small-scale wave energy converter (WEC) to power marine equipment has a broad prospect. Taking a direct-drive 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) wave energy converter (SJTU-WEC) as the research object, this paper proposes a load optimization control based on machine learning. The coupling dynamic model of SJTU-WEC (wave-to-wire model) is derived first in time domain and frequency domain. With the relationship between load resistance and power conversion efficiency revealing, load optimization control strategy is established. Subsequently, the prediction model based on machine learning, combining Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), is introduced to make short-term prediction of wave conditions and provide positive guidance to the load optimization control strategy. Finally, according to the historical data collected from an offshore area in Lianyungang, China, the performance of the prediction model and load optimization control strategy is evaluated. The numerical results show that the annual power output of the SJTU-WEC equipped with load optimization control based on machine learning reaches up to 81.2 W and increases by 5.1% compared with the same device carried with fixed load resistance. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Load optimization control strategy; Machine learning (EEMD-LSTM); SJTU-WEC; Wave energy","China; Jiangsu; Lianyungang; Digital storage; Forecasting; Frequency domain analysis; Long short-term memory; Offshore oil well production; Control strategies; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Load optimization control strategy; Load resistances; Machine learning (ensemble empirical mode decomposition-long short-term memory); Optimization control; Prediction modelling; SJTU-wave energy converter; Wave energy; Wave energy converters; alternative energy; control system; machine learning; offshore engineering; optimization; wave energy; Wave energy conversion","W.

Smart grids (SGs) work by collecting data about customer requests, comparing them to current supply data, computing electricity costs, and so on. Because the processes are time-dependent, a dynamic estimate of SG stability is a critical system need. Analyzing fluctuations and disturbances in a dynamic manner is critical for the SGs to work properly. Recent advancements in data science, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models have facilitated the creation of useful stability prediction models for the SGs environment. In this regard, this study provides an Artificial Hummingbird (AHB) algorithm-based feature selection model for the SG environment with optimal DL enabled stability prediction (AHBFS-ODLSP). The AHBFS-ODLSP model is primarily concerned with the design of an AHB-based feature selection technique. Furthermore, a prediction system based on Multiheaded-Self Attention Long Short-Term Memory (MHSA-LSTM) is being created right now to predict the stability level. Then, using the symbiotic organism search (SOS) optimization technique, the MHSA-LSTM model hyperparameters were adjusted. The AHBFS and SOS algorithm designs have a big impact on how well the MHSA-LSTM model predicts stability. AHBFS-ODLSP model modifications are demonstrated through a number of simulations, and the outcomes are assessed in a variety of ways. The AHBFS-ODLSP method has achieved its maximum performance with a F score of 99.02 %. The AHBFS-ODLSP model outperformed other prediction models, according to a thorough comparative analysis. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Data Science; Deep learning; Prediction model; Renewable energy; Smart grid; Stability analysis","Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; System stability; Systems engineering; Deep learning; Features selection; Grid environments; Memory modeling; Prediction modelling; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Stability analyze; Stability prediction; Symbiotics; Smart power grids","S.

This is a result of the various advantages of composite materials over their monolithic counterparts, such as high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and superior fatigue performance. However, there is a lack of detailed knowledge in relation to fusion joining techniques for composite materials. In this work, ultrasonic welding is carried out on a carbon fibre/PEKK composite material bonded to carbon fibre/epoxy composite to investigate the influence of weld process parameters on the joint’s lap shear strength (LSS), the process repeatability, and the process induced defects. A 33 parametric study is carried out and a robust machine learning model is developed using a hybrid genetic algorithm–artificial neural network (GA–ANN) trained on the experimental data. Bayesian optimisation is employed to determine the most suitable GA–ANN hyperparameters and the resulting GA–ANN surrogate model is exploited to optimise the welding process, where the process performance metrics are LSS, repeatability and joint visual quality. The prediction for the optimal LSS was subsequently validated through a further set of experiments, which resulted in a prediction error of just 3%. © 2022, The Author(s).","Artificial neural network; Bayesian optimisation; Dissimilar materials; Genetic algorithm; Machine learning; Ultrasonic welding","Carbon fibers; Composite materials; Corrosion resistance; Digital storage; Dissimilar materials; Genetic algorithms; Machine learning; Machinery; Multiobjective optimization; Renewable energy resources; Ultrasonic welding; Automotives; Bayesian optimization; Composites material; Dissimilar joints; Industry sectors; Lap shear strength; Monolithic counterparts; Multi-objectives optimization; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy storages; Neural networks","P.G.

Accurate and reliable solar radiation prediction is critical to the application of solar energy. In particular, a novel solar radiation prediction based on wavelet transform (WT), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), improved atom search optimization (IASO) and outlier-robust extreme learning machine (ORELM) is proposed for solar radiation prediction. First, WT is used to denoise the original solar radiation time series, and CEEMDAN method is used to decompose the denoised sequence into intrinsic mode function (IMF) components with different distributions according to the fluctuation scale. Then the IASO algorithm is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of the ORELM to improve the performance of the ORELM model. Levy flight is added to the ASO to enhance the local and global search capability while the chaos population initialization based on piecewise linear chaotic map (PWLCM) is taken to improve the randomness and ergodicity of the initial population within the feasible region. Finally, the comparison with other benchmark models verifies the robustness and accuracy of the proposed solar radiation prediction model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Atom search optimization; CEEMDAN; Outlier-robust extreme learning machine; Solar radiation prediction; Wavelet transform","Chaotic systems; Forecasting; Machine learning; Piecewise linear techniques; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Statistics; Wavelet decomposition; Adaptive noise; Atom search optimization; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Learning machines; Outlier-robust extreme learning machine; Prediction modelling; Search optimization; Solar radiation predictions; Wavelets transform; algorithm; chaotic dynamics; decomposition; machine learning; optimization; outlier; solar radiation; wavelet analysis; Empirical mode decomposition","T.

Once the main forcing components for driving the tides have deterministic dynamics, the available energy in a given TRS has been estimated, through analytical and numerical optimisation routines, as a mostly predictable event. This constraint imposes state-of-art flexible operation methods to rely on tidal predictions to infer best operational strategies for TRS, with the additional cost of requiring to run optimisation routines for every new tide. In this paper, a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach (Proximal Policy Optimisation through Unity ML-Agents) is introduced to perform automatic operation of TRS. For validation, the performance of the proposed method is compared with six different operation optimisation approaches devised from the literature, utilising the Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon as a case study. We show that our approach is successful in maximising energy generation through an optimised operational policy of turbines and sluices, yielding competitive results with state-of-art optimisation strategies, with the clear advantages of requiring training once and performing real-time automatic control of TRS with measured ocean data only. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deep reinforcement learning; Machine learning; Marine renewable energy; Proximal policy optimisation; Tidal energy; Tidal power plants","Swansea Bay; United Kingdom; Wales; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Optimization; Reinforcement learning; Tidal power; Tidal power plants; Case-studies; Flexible control; Marine renewable energy; Optimization routine; Policy optimization; Proximal policy optimization; Real- time; Swansea; Tidal energy; Tidal ranges; alternative energy; energy policy; lagoon; machine learning; policy approach; tidal power; Deep learning","T.M.

From a pool of Global Climate Models variables and ground-based observations, the optimal features are selected through a metaheuristic Feature Selection algorithm, an Atom Search Optimization method. The hyperparameters of the proposed CSVR are optimized by mean of the HyperOpt method, and the overall performance of the objective algorithm is benchmarked against eight alternative DL methods, and some of the other Machine Learning approaches (LSTM, DBN, RBF, BRF, MARS, WKNNR, GPML and M5TREE) methods. The results obtained shows that the proposed CSVR model can offer several predictive advantages over the alternative DL models, as well as the conventional ML models. Specifically, we note that the CSVR model recorded a root mean square error/mean absolute error ranging between ≈ 2.172–3.305 MJ m2/1.624–2.370 MJ m2 over the six tested solar farms compared to ≈ 2.514–3.879 MJ m2/1.939–2.866 MJ m2 from alternative ML and DL algorithms. Consistent with this predicted error, the correlation between the measured and the predicted GSR, including the Willmott's, Nash-Sutcliffe's coefficient and Legates & McCabe's Index was relatively higher for the proposed CSVR model compared to other DL and Machine Learning methods for all of the study sites. Accordingly, this study advocates the merits of CSVR model to provide a viable alternative to accurately predict GSR for renewable energy exploitation, energy demand or other forecasting-based applications. © 2022 The Author(s)","Convolutional Neural Networks; Feature selection; Hybrid models; Solar energy prediction; Support Vector Regression","Climate change; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Errors; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Time series; Australia; Convolutional neural network; Energy prediction; Features selection; Hybrid model; Learning models; Queensland; Solar energy prediction; Solar radiation predictions; Support vector regressions; Climate models","S.

Moreover, the effective utilization of RERs to fulfill the varying electricity demands of customers can be achieved via demand response (DR). Furthermore, control techniques, decision variables and offered motivations are the ways to introduce DR into distribution network (DN). This categorization needs to be optimized to balance the supply and demand in DN. Therefore, intelligent algorithms are employed to achieve optimized DR. However, these algorithms are computationally restrained to handle the parametric load of uncertainty involved with RERs and power system. Henceforth, this paper focuses on the limitations of intelligent algorithms for DR. Furthermore, a comparative study of different intelligent algorithms for DR is discussed. Based on conclusions, quantum algorithms are recommended to optimize the computational burden for DR in future smartgrid. © 2022 by the authors.

Several studies have been carried out; but still the objective of achieving accurate forecasting dependent on the spatio- temporal features is not achieved. To address this critical forecasting issue in this research article a hyper parametric tuning of the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machine learning model has been carried out using two met heuristic algorithms: Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). The dataset comprises five years of metrological attributes collected from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for analysis. The validation of the proposed model has been done based on the five statistical errors: Max Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of Determination (R2), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The regressive assessment of all three models has confirmed that the XGB-MFO model Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) respectively which ensures the proposed model implementation for the prediction and production of solar power. © 2022 ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING.","Extreme Gradient Boosting; Forecasting; Grey Wolf Optimization; Moth Flame Optimization; Solar irradiance","","","","VSB-Technical University of Ostrava","13361376","","","","English","Adv.

Transient stability issues in a contemporary electrical power system represent one of the difficult tasks for an electrical engineer due to the rise in uncertain renewable energy sources (RESs) as a result of the need for green energy. The potential for terminal voltage to be adversely impacted by this greater RES raises the possibility of electrical device damage. It is possible to use a solid state transformer (SST) or smart transformer to address a transient response issue. These devices are frequently employed to interact between RES and a power grid. SST features a variety of regulated converters to maintain the necessary voltage levels. This method can therefore simultaneously lessen power fluctuations and transient responsiveness. In order to improve the quality of RES power injections and the electrical system's transient stability, this work provides a controller design for a solar photovoltaic (SPV) system that is connected to the grid by SST. The optimization of a controller model is proposed by modifying a PI controller taken from a commercial one. With the use of IEEE 39 standard buses, the proposed controller is tested. When evaluating the effectiveness of a suggested controller, it is important to take into account a variety of solar radiation patterns as well as a time delay uncertainty that can range from 425 ms to 525 ms. According to simulation results, the proposed controller can be employed to lessen power fluctuation brought on by unpredictable RES. Additionally, the proposed coordinated regulation of SPV and SST can prevent catastrophic damage in the event of substantial disturbances like a circuit breaker collapsing to expand a power line due to a fault by inhibiting significant voltage cycles within an electronic appliance's rated voltage limit. The results indicate that a transitory stability issue in a modern power system caused by an unforeseen increase in RES may be addressed utilizing the suggested controllers as alternatives.  © 2023 Kailash Kumar et al.","","Electric circuit breakers; Electric power system control; Electric power system stability; Machine learning; Power quality; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Transient analysis; Controller designs; Fault prediction; Intelligent controllers; Machine learning models; Optimisations; Power fluctuations; Renewable energy source; Solid phasis; Stability issues; State-transformers; Controllers","K.

By implementing different renewable energy sources, like photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, RMGs can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance proficiency. The paper suggests a RMG energy management method based on machine learning, which considers a reconfigurable frame according to the remote link switching and segmentation. The proposed scheme investigates advanced support vector machines to model and estimates the charging demand (ChD) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). To reduce the load impact of HEV on the network, 2 various cases have been implemented; one is coordinated, and the other is smartly charged. Because of the complex construction of the problem statement, an improved optimization technique according to the gray wolf is proposed. The simulation outcomes of the IEEE microgrid (MG) trial system depict that it is of adequate and efficient quality in both cases. Based on the result of the forecast for the total charge demand of HEVs, the average absolute percentage error is 0.978 that is so small. Furthermore, the outcomes are shown that, compared to the coordination scheme, the total operating cost of the MG in smart load is reduced by 2.5%. © 2021","Energy management; Gray wolf algorithm; Hybrid electric vehicle; Microgrid; Optimization; Remote switching","Decision trees; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Microgrids; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Support vector machines; Vehicle-to-grid; Gray wolf algorithm; Gray wolves; Grid management; Learning techniques; Microgrid; Optimisations; Reconfigurable; Remote switching; Smart grid; Support vector regressions; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy management; machine learning; optimization; regression analysis; smart grid; support vector machine; Energy management","J.

Thermoelectric generation (TEG) systems as a green energy resource are designed to recover waste heat recovery. Concentrated solar tackles the disadvantages of low power generation efficiency. This paper investigates the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) based MPPT technique, to harvest maximum power of a centralized TEG system under various operating conditions. The environment-dependent issues such as the non-constant distribution of heat, loss to the heat transfer coating between sinks and sources, and mechanical faults create non-uniform current generation and impedance mismatch causing power loss. In this article, we have proposed a feed-forward neural network (FNN) trained by a novel flow direction algorithm (FDA) with a tuned PID controller to harvest the energy under non-uniform temperature gradient conditions. The non-uniformity of physical conditions generates multiple local maxima's (LMs) in electrical characteristics of TEG systems. Common gradient-based MPPT techniques are unlikely to track true GMPP. As a solution to this non-linear problem, novel FNN-FDA is tested under non uniformly distributed temperature (NTUD) over heat source surfaces under varying load and temperature conditions. In this study, certain contributions to the field of TEG systems were made by tackling the issues such as GMPP tracking, low efficiency, and oscillations around GMPP. The results are compared to the particle swarm optimization (PSO), Barnacle mating optimization (BMO), and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Five experiments under different weather conditions are performed. Results are validated and proved with experiments and MATLAB/SIMULINK. The experimental results demonstrated that FNN-FDA performs significantly better when compared with other control techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Flow direction optimization algorithm (FDA); Maximum power point tracking (MPPT); Swarm intelligence (SI); Thermoelectric generator (TEG)","Electronic equipment; Feedforward neural networks; Fossil fuels; Heat transfer; Machine learning; Maximum power point trackers; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Sustainable development; Swarm intelligence; Thermoelectric equipment; Three term control systems; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Flow direction; Flow direction optimization algorithm; Generator systems; Green energy; Maximum Power Point Tracking; Optimization algorithms; Swarm intelligence; Thermoelectric generator; Thermoelectric generators; Renewable energy resources","M.H.

Therefore, a new idea is proposed to solve the real-time dispatching problem considering the uncertainty by using the deep learning method based on massive historical data. Firstly, the load matrix correlation analysis is used to determine the basic structure of the training sample set for each dispatching instant. Secondly, based on the perfect dispatching theory proposed by the PJM electricity market in USA, the training objectives of the learning model are generated, and the differentiated training sample set of each adaptive learning model is constructed. Then, an long short-term memory network with internal input update (LSTM-IIU) is proposed to form a real-time adaptive learning dispatching model for each dispatching instant. Finally, the feasibility and applicability of the proposed method are verified by the standard WSCC 9-bus and IEEE 118-bus examples.

Manufacturing is no exception. However, Smart Manufacturing, the digital practice, organization, workforce, and infrastructure transformation for collection and deployment of data and models at scale and at all levels of manufacturing, is a complex, costly, and labor-intensive journey that is still seeing slow adoption. The Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII), a national Manufacturing USA public-private partnership sponsored by the Department of Energy, is addressing this scaled use of data and modeling in manufacturing. CESMII has focused on how to collect and use operating data for numerous applications that improve productivity, precision, and performance of manufacturing operations from factory floor to supply chain using process simulation, predictive analytics, monitoring and control, and real-time optimization. Because contextualized data are key, CESMII has developed the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform (SMIP) to lower the barriers to the data that are needed to accelerate data-based model building, improve data visualization, and more quickly gain insights. Reusable, standards-based ways of doing data collection, ingestion, and contextualization are particularly important for scaling access and use of data. The SMIP uses a standards-based definition and construct for reusable information models called an SM Profile. When an SM Profile is used in conjunction with the SMIP, the SMIP ensures the availability of contextualized, operational data for model building. The present work demonstrates Smart Manufacturing and the application of the SMIP for building several data-centered models for the operation and control of an experimental electrochemical reactor that reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to valuable liquid and gas chemicals, such as alcohols, olefins, and syngas. We describe how the SMIP plays a central role in more effective model building and we demonstrate how the electochemical reactor can be controlled and optimized for the desired products. Use of the SMIP involves the transmission of real-time sensor measurements to a cloud resource so that the operating data are available to all model building experts. The data collection and transmission process is fully automated to greatly reduce the need for manual manipulation of the data. Data-driven machine learning models are used for advanced real-time state estimation, real-time optimization, and model-based feedback control for the reactor. The application models are implemented as a system to monitor the data flow and control the electrochemical reactor with a single visualization interface. SM Profiles are used to demonstrate reusability of the information models for the reactor and the instrumentation. The application packages, algorithms, and user interfaces developed are cast as Docker images in a library to facilitate reusability of the application models. © 2022 The Author(s)","CO<sub>2</sub> reduction; Data connectivity; Data-driven modeling; Electrochemical reactor; Gas chromatography; Machine learning; Smart manufacturing innovation platform","","P.D.

Our developed hybrid models uses a triplet of signal decomposition method, regression model and meta-heuristic algorithm. We have used the \epsilon -Support Vector Regression ( \epsilon -SVR), Least Squares Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Large-margin Distribution Machine based Regression (LDMR) model for the regression task. For signal decomposition methods, we have considered the Wavelet Decomposition (WD), Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) method. Apart from this, we have also used the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method to tune the parameters of the used regression model in our wave hybrid models. Till now, the VMD method and LDMR model have not been used in any wave hybrid model. We have evaluated the performance of our developed wave hybrid models on time-series significant wave heights, collected from four different buoys using the different evaluation criteria. After the detailed statistical analysis of the obtained numerical results, we conclude that the VMD-PSO-LDMR based wave hybrid model obtain best performance on six datasets out of seven considered datasets. Also, the VMD based wave hybrid models can obtain better performance than other decomposition based hybrid models. Further, we also conclude from our numerical results that the LSTM model outperforms the SVR, LS-SVR and LDMR based hybrid models if we do not decompose the significant wave height signals apriori. But, when we decompose the SWH time-series signals using a particular decomposition method, then SVR, LS-SVR and LDMR based hybrid models tend to improve their prediction ability significantly.  © 2013 IEEE.","empirical mode decomposition; hybrid model; machine learning; renewable energy; Support vector regression; wave height prediction; wavelet transform","Forecasting; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Numerical models; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Time series; Vectors; Water waves; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Hybrid model; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Signal resolution; Solid modelling; Support vector regressions; Support vectors machine; Task analysis; Wave height prediction; Wavelet-analysis; Wavelets transform; Empirical mode decomposition","P.

The parabolic trough collector, vanadium chloride thermochemical cycle, hydrogen storage tank, alkaline fuel cells, thermal energy storage, and absorption chiller make up the suggested smart system. Additionally, the proposed system includes a wind turbine to power the electrolyzer unit and minimize the size of the solar system. A rule-based control technique establishes an intelligent two-way connection with energy networks to compensate for the energy expenses throughout the year. The transient system simulation (TRNSYS) tool and the engineering equation solver program are used to conduct a comprehensive techno-economic-environmental assessment of a Swedish residential building. A four-objective optimization utilizing MATLAB based on the grey wolf algorithm coupled with an artificial neural network is used to determine the best trade-off between the indicators. According to the results, the primary energy saving, carbon dioxide reduction rate, overall cost, and purchased energy are 80.6 %, 219 %, 14.8 $/h, and 24.9 MWh at optimal conditions. From the scatter distribution, it can be concluded that fuel cell voltage and collector length should be maintained at their lowest domain and the electrode area is an ineffective parameter. The suggested renewable-driven smart system can provide for the building's needs for 70 % of the year and sell excess production to the local energy network, making it a feasible alternative. Solar energy is far less effective in storing hydrogen over the winter than wind energy, demonstrating the benefits of combining renewable energy sources to fulfill demand. By lowering CO2 emissions by 61,758 kg, it is predicted that the recommended smart renewable system might save 7719 $ in environmental costs, equivalent to 6.9 ha of new reforestation. © 2022 The Authors","Energy management; Fuel cell; Hydrogen storage; Multi-objective optimization; Solar collector; Thermal energy storage","Carbon dioxide; Chlorine compounds; Desalination; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electric power distribution; Energy conservation; Energy management; Fuel cells; Heat storage; Hydrogen storage; MATLAB; Neural networks; Solar collectors; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Thermal energy; Wind power; Control and optimization; Demand reduction; Energy networks; Hybridisation; Machine learning techniques; Multi-objectives optimization; Peak demand; Rule based; Smart System; Thermal energy storage; Multiobjective optimization","A.

Although this type of power plant could positively affect society in terms of clean and sustainable energy, it also brings adverse effects, especially with the stability of the power system. The lack of inertia and different dynamic characteristics are the main issues associated with power-electronics-based power plants that could affect the oscillatory behaviour of the power system. Hence, it is important to design a comprehensive damping controller to damp oscillations due to the integration of a power-electronics-based power plant. This paper proposes a damping method for enhancing the oscillatory stability performance of power systems with high penetration of renewable energy systems. A resilient wide-area multimodal controller is proposed and used in conjunction with a battery energy storage system (BESS) to enhance the damping of critical modes. The proposed control also addresses resiliency issues associated with control signals and controllers. The optimal tuning of the control parameters for this proposed controller is challenging. Hence, the firefly algorithm was considered to be the optimisation method to design the wide-area multimodal controllers for BESS, wind, and photovoltaic (PV) systems. The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using a modified version of the Java Indonesian power system under various operating conditions. Both eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulations are considered in the analysis. A comparison with other well-known metaheuristic methods was also carried out to show the proposed method’s efficacy. Obtained results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed approach in enhancing the small-signal stability of renewable-rich power systems. They also revealed that the proposed multimodal controller could enhance the penetration of renewable energy sources in the Javan power system by up to 50%. © 2022 by the authors.

In this regard, this paper proposes a secured stochastic energy management scheme for both grid-connected and islanded hybrid AC-DC MGs (HMGs) considering renewable energy sources (RESs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and energy storage devices (ESs). In this work, the operation of HMGs is formulated as a single objective optimization problem, which is solved using the interior search optimization algorithm (ISOA). In order to reinforce data security in HMGs, a deep learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) and prediction interval is proposed to detect false data injection attacks (FDIA) on advanced metering infrastructures (AMIs). In this work, the 2 m point estimation method is utilized to model uncertainties associated with the forecasted output power of RESs, energy market price, charging demand of PHEVs, and load demand. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using IEEE 33 bus test system for both operation modes. © 2021","Cybersecurity; Energy management; Hybrid microgrids; Long short-term memory; Prediction interval","Brain; Cost effectiveness; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy management; Intrusion detection; Network security; Optimization; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Stochastic systems; Cyber security; Energy; Hybrid microgrid; Micro grid; Operations cost; Plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); Prediction interval; Renewable energy source; Short term memory; Stochastics; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy management; energy market; energy storage; machine learning; prediction; Long short-term memory","X.

In order to reduce the intra-day dispatch pressure, this paper proposes a data-driven two-stage day-ahead dispatch model for islanded Micro-Grid. The first stage dispatch model considers multiple demand responses, and applies phase space reconstruction and machine learning to predict renewable energy output and power load. Multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the first stage dispatch model. For the obtained Pareto Front, weight multiple objectives by entropy weight method to get the optimal solution. Since the deviation between the predicted value and the actual value can lead to renewable energy curtailment or load loss, the role of the second stage is to predict the renewable energy curtailment and load loss after the first stage dispatch. Firstly, extreme gradient boosting is used to predict when renewable energy curtailment and load loss occur. Secondly, extreme learning machine is used to predict the amount of renewable energy curtailment and load loss at the corresponding time points. Finally, linear programming and mixed integer linear programming are used to solve the second stage dispatch model. By comparative cases analysis, simulation results show that the enhancement of demand response to system efficiency is at the cost of increasing dispatch cost and reducing reliability. In contrast, the proposed two-stage dispatch method using regulation reserve capacity not only reduces dispatch cost, but also improves system efficiency and reliability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data-driven; Demand response; Multi-objective economic dispatch; Uncertainty of source and load","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric load dispatching; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Integer programming; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Phase space methods; Reliability analysis; Data driven; Demand response; Economic Dispatch; Islanded micro grids; Multi objective; Multi-objective economic dispatch; Power load; Renewable energies; Uncertainty; Uncertainty of source and load; Scheduling","X.

Intelligent control systems are required to anticipate and optimize the charging and discharging of energy storage. In recent years, reinforcement learning based techniques have been applied to a multitude of problems, including building integrated energy storage solutions. In this work, the focus is on the application of reinforcement learning based techniques to the specific energy optimization problem of controlling a battery energy storage system in a smart warehouse. This paper adopts data from a real operational battery energy storage system installed in a smart warehouse, integrated with photovoltaic, for food distribution on the west coast of Norway.

Merely improving the statistical quality of PIs with respect to calibration and sharpness cannot always contribute to the operational value for specific decision-making issue. In this paper, the cost-oriented prediction intervals are firstly proposed to achieve the joint improvement of forecasting quality and decision performance. In order to bridge the gap between forecasting and decision, a novel cost-oriented machine learning (COML) framework is established, which unifies nonparametric renewable power PI construction and decision-making. Formulated as a bilevel programming model, the COML minimizes the operational costs of decision-making process by adaptively adjusting the quantile proportion pair of PIs resulting from extreme learning machine based quantile regression. The hierarchical optimization model of the COML is equivalently simplified as a single level nonlinear programming problem. Then an enhanced branch-and-contract algorithm with innovative bounds contraction strategy is devised to efficiently capture the optimum of the single level problem with bilinear nonconvexity. Numerical experiments based on actual wind farm data simulate the online forecasting and decision process for wind power offering. Comprehensive comparisons verify the substantial superiority of the proposed COML methodology in terms of forecasting quality, operational value, as well as computational efficiency for practical application.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.","decision making; forecasting; machine learning; Prediction interval; renewable energy; uncertainty","Computational efficiency; Costs; Electric power generation; Integer programming; Learning systems; Nonlinear programming; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Decisions makings; Prediction interval; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Single level; Uncertainty; Uncertainty quantifications; Wind power generation; Decision making","C.

The target was to solve the two subtasks of forecasting the base load and of computing an optimal schedule of a list of energy intensive activities with inter-dependencies.

For instance, developments of turn-key demand response aggregation and optimisation of distributed loads are rapidly emerging across the globe in a variety of business models focused on maximising the inherent flexibility and diversity of the behind-the-meter assets. However, even though these developments’ added value is understood and of wide interest, measurement of the desired levels of consumer engagement is still on demonstration stages and assessment of technology readiness. In this paper, we analyse the characteristics of the loads, the behaviour of parameters, and in a final extent, the behaviour of each kind of consumer participating in aggregated demand scheduling. We apply both non-automatic and machine learning methods to extract the relevant factors and to recognise the potential consumer behaviour on a series of scenarios that are drawn using both synthetic data and living labs datasets. Our experimentation showcases a number of three patterns in which factors like the community's demand volume and the consumer's flexibility dominate and impact the performance of the tested development. The experimentation also makes current limitations arise within the existing electricity consumption datasets and their potential for inference and forecasting demand flexibility analytics. © 2021 The Author(s)","Aggregated demand scheduling; Automatic demand profiling; Clustering analysis; Demand response; Flexibility impact; Load patterns","Consumer behavior; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Aggregated demand scheduling; Automatic demand profiling; Behavioral patterns; Clustering analysis; Demand response; Energy efficient technology; Flexibility impact; Load patterns; Renewable energies; Renewables; alternative energy; cluster analysis; demand-side management; energy policy; optimization; Scheduling","C.

Better short/medium-term forecasts that provide reliable and strategic planning insights will allow the energy industry to plan for these extremes. In order to efficiently quantify uncertainty, this study proposes a Gaussian stochastic-based machine learning process model (GPR) for short/medium-term energy, solar, and wind (ESW) power forecasts using two different temporal resolutions of data. Four experimental steps (EXMS) were designed. Each EXMS is designed with four distinct fitting and predicting methods, and the GPR model uses seven kernel covariance functions for hyperparameter optimization. Real-time data is used for the forecasting analysis at three different locations. The forecasting results are validated using three existing models. The percent coefficient of variation of CVGPR1 and CVGPR2 of EXMS-1 and EXMS-3 for ESW power forecasts is 0.017%, 0.057%, 0.025%, and 0.223%, 0.225%, 0.170%, respectively. Accuracy has shown that the proposed model can predict ESW power simultaneously at two different temporal resolution data. The GPR accuracy with four EXMS methodologies is promising by addressing ESW power forecasts under the GPR framework of significant utilities, independent power producers, and public interest. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural networks; Machine learning; Multi-objective optimization; Objective functions; Renewable energy forecasting; Stochastic Gaussian process model","Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Public utilities; Stochastic models; Weather forecasting; Wind power; Energy; Machine-learning; Medium term; Multi-objectives optimization; Neural-networks; Objective functions; Renewable energy forecasting; Solar and winds; Stochastic gaussian process model; Wind power forecast; energy policy; experimental apparatus; Gaussian method; ground penetrating radar; machine learning; numerical model; solar power; wind power; Stochastic systems","T.

Modern power systems need to deal with the uncertain and volatile behavior of their components (especially, renewable energy generation); this necessitates the use of increased operating reserves. To ameliorate this expensive requirement, intelligent systems for determining appropriate unit commitment schedules have risen as a promising solution. This is especially the case for weak power systems with low dispatching flexibility and high dependency on imported fossil fuels. In this work, we introduce a radically new paradigm for addressing the optimal unit commitment problem, that is capable of accounting for the largely unaddressed challenge of the uncertain and volatile behavior of modern power systems. Our solution leverages widely adopted developments in the field of uncertainty-aware machine learning models, namely Bayesian optimization. This framework enables the effective discovery of the best possible configuration of a volatile system with uncertain and unknown dynamics, without the need of introducing restrictive prior assumptions. Based on appropriately selected acquisition function and Gaussian process regression, it constitutes a radically different from existing approaches, which heavily rely on heuristic approximations and do not allow to account for volatile behavioral patterns. On the contrary, it guarantees global optimum solutions in non-convex optimization tasks in the least possible number of trials. The demonstrated results show better performance in terms of total production cost and number of function evaluations, inspiring system operators to better schedule their power networks in the forthcoming, de-carbonized grids. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bayesian optimization; Global optimization; Machine learning model; Unit commitment; Volatile behavioral patterns","Carbonization; Convex optimization; Fossil fuels; Gaussian distribution; Global optimization; Intelligent systems; Machine learning; Renewable energy resources; Bayesian optimization; Data driven; Gaussian Processes; Global optimisation; Machine learning models; Power; Process-based; Unit Commitment; Volatile behavioral pattern; Volatile behaviors; Gaussian noise (electronic)","P.

Despite a plethora of optimal energy trading solutions, optimizing the trading cost and intelligent formation of energy sharing strategies are deemed exigent problems. Contemplating the excessive rise of energy demands across the globe, this study introduces a predictive optimization-based nanogrid energy trading model that minimizes energy trading cost and provides an optimal energy sharing plan between peers connected within a nanogrid network/cluster. The proposed study comprises two folds: (1) PSO-enabled objective function incorporating actual and predicted values of essential energy attributes, is implemented to reduce the trading cost, (2) an intelligent time-aware energy sharing strategy to determine the role of peers, and foster the harness of renewable energy to meet the energy requirements. The study also comprehensively analyzes essential nano-grid energy parameters and predicts energy load, consumption, and cost to grasp the time-interval-based energy trends. In addition, an optimal ESS charging and discharging operation is devised to manage excess power efficiently. The proposed model is validated on the case study containing data of 12 nanogrid houses. The outcomes yield that the proposed study holds significant potential in reducing the trading cost and optimally sharing the energy within the P2P network.  © 2013 IEEE.","energy prediction; Energy trading; machine learning; optimization; predictive analysis","Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Distributed computer systems; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Energy utilization; Green computing; Long short-term memory; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Smart power grids; Solar cells; Solar energy; Biological system modeling; Energy prediction; Energy sharings; Energy trading; Load modeling; Nanogrids; Optimisations; Peer-to-peer computing; Predictive models; Energy efficiency","D.

Using historical solar irradiance, a short-term forecasting model known as Robust optimized functional link broad learning system (FLBLS) is developed. Here the original input comprising delayed historical solar irradiance samples is initially expanded by exponential trigonometric functions and the expanded features are then used to create a large number of feature nodes using random weights and biases. Further the newly created features are fed as inputs to the enhancement nodes forming a broad learning system (BLS). This newly formed flat FLBLS facilitates incremental learning in fast remodelling of the network if needed for efficient performance without a retraining process unlike deep neural networks using several hidden layers and filters, etc. The proposed approach is designed on the basis of the standard random vector functional link network (RVFLN), however unlike the traditional RVFLN that applies inputs directly and set up the enhancement nodes, in our proposed approach, initially the inputs are expanded and map the expanded inputs to generate a set of mapped features. It reduces the lengthy process unlike deep neural networks that involves the back propagation algorithm for error minimization. The proposed FLBLS approach simplifies the learning process with the proper choice of feature nodes as it can be implemented to a flat network or a simpler network such as ELM that requires only the simple calculation of the output weight and obtain the final output where retraining is not required for adding extra feature nodes or enhancement nodes like deep neural architectures. Also, the minimum variance strategy with the training samples is useful in rejecting the effects of noise and outliers in the system and make the network robust which gets reflected in computing output weights using generalized least square. The minimum variance strategy further enhances the performance of the proposed system. To improve the prediction accuracy, the FLBLS parameters are optimized using an efficient metaheuristic chaotic firefly-sine cosine levy flight algorithm. Also, to reject the effects of noise and outliers and make the network robust a minimum variance strategy is used with the training samples that gets reflected in computing output weights using generalised least squares. The suggested method is experimented rigorously and analysed with different time frames designed for 30 min and 60 min ahead solar irradiance prediction. The obtained results from experiments confirm that the proposed FLBLS approach outperforms other randomized neural network forecasting methods as well many state-of-the-art methods using solar irradiance data of Hyderabad, India collected from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This approach exhibits with the lowest errors in different case studies among all the compared methods. This FLBLS designed approach is an efficient approach for the purpose of solar irradiance prediction with highly nonlinear data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Broad learning system (BLS); Deep learning; Exponential trigonometric functional expansion; Firefly sine–cosine levy flight optimization algorithm; Minimum variance; Random vector functional link network (RVFLN); Robust exponential expanded random vector functional link net; Robust optimized functional link broad learning system (FLBLS); Solar irradiance prediction","Hyderabad [Telangana]; Bioluminescence; Deep neural networks; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Optimization; Sampling; Statistics; Vectors; Broad learning system; Deep learning; Exponential trigonometric functional expansion; Exponentials; Firefly sine–cosine levy flight optimization algorithm; Flight optimization; Functional expansion; Functional links; Functional-link net; Functional-link network; Levy flights; Minimum variance; Optimization algorithms; Random vector functional link network; Random vectors; Robust exponential expanded random vector functional link net; Robust optimized functional link broad learning system; Solar irradiance prediction; Solar irradiances; accuracy assessment; back propagation; climate conditions; machine learning; parameter estimation; solar radiation; Forecasting","P.K.

In this work, a multi-objective problem is formulated by combining the concept of demand side management (DSM) and Dynamic Economic Emission Dispatch (DEED). The multi-objective DSM–DEED problem is optimized by class topper optimization algorithm. In addition, an energy management algorithm (EMA) is proposed for optimal power utilization from various energy sources and to match the load demand with generated energy in presence of uncertainties of RESs. To get an accurate model, a random forest regression-based machine learning approach is considered in this paper to predict load demand, wind, and solar power on an hourly basis for a span of 24 hours. The objective here is to optimally schedule load consumption and power generation patterns simultaneously for a day to improve load factor, minimize operational cost, and maximize the profit of all the candidates of the electricity market simultaneously.

However, with the introduction of renewable energy, BES control becomes more complicated. The mismatch between supply and demand sides limits the further growth of renewable energy consumption, which is caused by fluctuation of renewable energy and randomness of load. Therefore, it is challenging to develop an efficient framework to realize the cooperative control of various controlled objects in supply and demand sides. To address this challenge, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework was proposed to optimize the energy management of the building. In this paper, a dueling double deep Q-network was used for optimization of single agent, and value-decomposition network was put forward to solve the cooperation optimization of multiple agents. Also, considering the controlled characteristics of BES, prioritized experience replay and feasible action screening mechanism were introduced to accelerate the convergence and maintain stability of the algorithm applied to BES. Simulation results show that, the multi-agent cooperation algorithm can realize the control of variously different devices at the same time and achieve multi-objective cooperation optimization of BES. Moreover, the proposed approach reduced the uncomfortable duration by 84%, the unconsumed amount of renewable energy by 43%, and the energy cost by 8% compared with the conventional rule-based control approach. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy system; Cooperation optimization; Deep reinforcement learning; Multi-agent cooperation; Renewable energy","Buildings; Economics; Energy utilization; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Building energy systems; Cooperation optimization; Demand-side; Learning optimizations; Multi agent; Multi agent cooperation; Optimisations; Optimization framework; Renewable energies; Supply sides; algorithm; alternative energy; energy management; machine learning; optimization; Deep learning","Q.

The methods are applied in estimating the temperature of nanofluids (TiO2, 25 ppm, 75 ppm), and as specific objective, we verify how the external factors like ambient temperature, solar radiation temperature, date, time, direct, diffuse and global solar irradiance can affect the temperature of the nanofluid and thus the choice of the working fluid is made. The thermal behavior of these working fluids provides conditions to evaluate the performance of a direct absorption solar collector. For this, temperature sensors are built into the solar collector and a solar irradiance measurement station provides the required data. Statistical calculations performed on the collected and modeled data show that the Random Forest model achieves the best results. The method was able to model the data correctly obtaining a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.613 ºC. On the other hand, the Regression Trees method with Bagging obtained less satisfactory results computing an RMSE of 1.694 °C.

A few large power plants feed the power grid and the aim is to ensure that the demand and supply are always balanced. The traditional energy management schemes in a grid are aimed towards energy system optimization. Although there is considerable experience with the optimization of energy production and distribution, researchers and industries are increasingly focused on the demand side. The reliable operation of a grid demands the electricity supply and load demand to be constantly and precisely balanced in real-time. However, it is difficult to achieve this balance since both supply and demand could change unexpectedly and significantly due to intermittent power surge/drop from Renewable Energy Resources (RES), sudden load changes, and forced outages in generation units or other components of the power grid. In such scenarios, Demand Side Management (DSM) in addition to generation control can help to manage and match the customer load with the supply system. Past research works have demonstrated how various heating and cooling loads in buildings/industries can be used as a Demand Side Storage (DSS). In this paper, a water storage plant has been used as a DSS. A novel Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based Genetic algorithm has been utilized to optimize two different objectives. The first objective is to find the dispatch schedule of the DSS while improve the generation efficiency of the conventional generating plant. This has been achieved without affecting its overall intended operation. The second objective is to maximize the operational lifetime of the pumps in the water storage plant by reducing their switching operations. The results have been compared with those obtained from a deterministic and other AI methods in order to verify its effectiveness under various conditions. In addition, real time simulation results have also been provided for the same case study in an IEEE 24 bus test system. © 2022","Artificial neural network; Demand response; Demand side management; Extreme machine learning; Genetic algorithm; Water storage plant","Demand side management; Economics; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Demand response; Demand-side; Extreme machine learning; Multi objective; Power grids; Smart grid; Storage plants; Trained neural networks; Water storage; Water storage plant; Neural networks","P.K.

It further examines barriers in the transition toward optimising the benefit opportunities between electricity demand and electricity supply. The main contribution of this study highlights the impact of individual end‐users by controlling and automating individual home electricity profiles within the objective function set (AV) of optimum demand ranges. Three stages of analysis were accomplished to achieve this goal. Firstly, we focused on feasibility analysis using ‘weight of evidence’ (WOE) and ‘information value’ (IV) techniques to check sample data segmentation and possible variable reduction. Stage two of sensitivity analysis (SA) used a generalised reduced gradient algorithm (GRG) to detect and compare a nonlinear opti-misation issue caused by end‐user demand. Stage three of analysis used two methods adopted from the machine learning toolbox, piecewise linear distribution (PLD) and the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), to test the normality of time series data and measure the discrepancy between them. It used PLD and ECDF to derive a nonparametric representation of the overall cumulative distribution function (CDF). These analytical methods were all found to be relevant and provided a clue to the sustainability approach. This study provides insights into the design of sustainable homes, which must go beyond the concept of increasing the capacity of renewable energy. In addition to this, this study examines the interplay between the variance estimation of the prob-lematic levels and the perception of energy loss to introduce a novel realistic model of cost–benefit incentives. This optimisation goal contrasted with uncertainties that remain as to what constitutes the demand impact and individual house effects in diverse clustering patterns in a specific grid system. While ongoing effort is still needed to look for strategic solutions for this class of complex problems, this research shows significant contextual opportunities to manage the complexity of the problem according to the nature of the case, representing dense and significant changes in the situ-ational complexity. © 2021 by the authors.

Features are employed as potential inputs for Long Short-Term Memory and a seq2seq SAELSTM autoencoder Deep Learning (DL) system in the final GSR prediction. Six solar energy farms in Queensland, Australia are considered to evaluate the method with predictors from Global Climate Models and ground-based observation. Comparisons are carried out among DL models (i.e., Deep Neural Network) and conventional Machine Learning algorithms (i.e., Gradient Boosting Regression, Random Forest Regression, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Adaptive Boosting Regression). The hyperparameters are deduced with grid search, and simulations demonstrate that the DL hybrid SAELSTM model is accurate compared with the other models as well as the persistence methods. The SAELSTM model obtains quality solar energy prediction intervals with high coverage probability and low interval errors.

There are five general approaches by which system operators and market participants can use probabilistic forecasts of wind, solar, and load to help manage this uncertainty. These include operator situation awareness, resource risk hedging, reserves procurement, definition of contingencies, and explicit stochastic optimization. We review these approaches, and then provide a case study in which a method for using probabilistic solar forecasts to define needs for reserves is developed and evaluated. The case study has three parts. First, we describe building blocks for enhancing the Watt-Sun solar forecasting system to produce probabilistic irradiance and power forecasts. Second, relationships between Watt-Sun forecasts for multiple sites in California and the system's need for flexible ramp capability (flexiramp) are defined by machine learning and statistical methods.

However, this approach can be problematic due to the temporal and spatial correlations between system cost and load prediction errors. This observation motivates us to jointly treat the two forms of correlations by adopting the notion of end-to-end machine learning. Thus, we first propose a task-specific learning criterion to conduct economic dispatch for maximal economic benefits. To reduce the task-specific approach's computational burden and over-fitting issues, we design an efficient optimization kernel to speed up the learning process. Additionally, we propose a more practical and robust model-free end-to-end learning framework and offer theoretical analysis and empirical insights to highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our three proposed learning frameworks. Our numerical study highlights that the model-free framework decreases the additional cost from an inaccurate prediction by 5.49% in the IEEE 39-bus system compared with the conventional approach.  © 2013 IEEE.","economic dispatch; Electric power networks; learning; optimization","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Electric load dispatching; Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Learning systems; Renewable energy resources; Economic Dispatch; Electric power networks; Generator; Kernel; Learning; Load modeling; Optimisations; Predictive models; Renewable energy source; Task analysis; Scheduling","C.

An efficient vehicle-to-grid (V2G) scheduling scheme that can deal with renewable energy volatility and protect vehicle batteries from fast aging is indispensable to enable this benefit. This article develops a novel V2G scheduling method for consuming local renewable energy in microgrids by using a mixed learning framework. It is the first attempt to integrate battery protective targets in GEVs charging management in renewable energy systems. Battery safeguard strategies are derived via an offline soft-run scheduling process, where V2G management is modeled as a constrained optimization problem based on estimated microgrid and GEVs states. Meanwhile, an online V2G regulator is built to facilitate the real-time scheduling of GEVs' charging. The extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is used to train the established online regulator by learning rules from soft-run strategies. The online charging coordination of GEVs is realized by the ELM regulator based on real-time sampled microgrid frequency. The effectiveness of the developed models is verified on a U.K. microgrid with actual energy generation and consumption data. This article can effectively enable V2G to promote local renewable energy with battery aging mitigated, thus economically benefiting EV owns and microgrid operators, and facilitating decarbonization at low costs.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; battery aging mitigation; electric vehicle; microgrid; renewable energy; vehicle to grid","Charging (batteries); Constrained optimization; Electric power transmission networks; Interactive computer systems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Real time systems; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery; Battery aging; Battery aging mitigation; Job-Shop scheduling; Microgrid; Real - Time system; Regulator; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Vehicle to grids; Renewable energy resources","C.

However, engineering-fidelity level tools and the empirical parameters pose challenges due to the strong nonlinear coupling effects of FOWTs. A novel method, named SADA, was proposed by Chen and Hu (2021) for optimizing the design and dynamic performance prediction of FOWTs in combination with AI technology. In the SADA method, the concept of Key Disciplinary Parameters (KDPs) is also proposed, and it is of crucial importance in the SADA method. The purpose of this paper is to make an in-depth investigation of the characters of KDPs and the internal correlations between different KDPs in the dynamic performance prediction of FOWTs. Firstly, a brief description of SADA is given, and the basin experimental data are used to conduct the training process of SADA. Secondly, categories and boundary conditions of KDPs are introduced. Three types of KDPs are given, and different boundary conditions are used to analyze KDPs. The results show that the wind and current in Environmental KDPs are strongly correlated with the percentage difference of dynamic response rather than that by wave parameters. In general, the optimization results of SADA consider the specific basin environment and the coupling results between different KDPs help the designers further understand the factors that have a more significant impact on the FOWTs system in a specific domain. © 2022, The Author(s).","basin experiment; floating offshore wind turbine; KDPs; machine learning; SADA","Boundary conditions; Energy harvesting; Forecasting; Mechanisms; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind turbines; Basin experiment; Disciplinary analysis; Dynamic performance; Empirical parameters; Floating offshore wind turbines; Key disciplinary parameter; Machine-learning; Offshore renewable energies; Performance prediction; SADA; Machine learning","P.

Due to its complex and hybrid nature, it has significant nonlinear features and substantial hysteresis behavior, making it hard to optimize and control its power generation directly. This study modeled power density and COD removal using random forest regression and gradient boost regression trees. System inputs are three key parameters that affect performance and commercialization. There is a range of 0.1–0.5 mg/cm2 of Pt, a degree of sulfonation of sulfonated polyether-etherketone varying from 20% to 80%, and a cathode aeration rate of 10–150 mL/min. Based on the model’s accuracies, gradient boost regression was selected for power density prediction and random forest for COD removal prediction. Particle swarm optimization was used as the optimization algorithm after selecting the best models to maximize COD removal and power density. It was found that DS was the most critical parameter for COD removal, and Pt was the most critical parameter for power density. There is a different optimal input value for each model. In order to maximize power density, DS (%) must be 67.7087, Pt (mg/cm2) must be 0.3943, and Aeration (mL/min) must be 117.7192.

It can generate temperatures above 2000 K (as high as 30,000 K) in a reactor, leading to complete combustion and reduction of toxic byproducts. Characterizing complex processes inside such a system is however challenging. In previous studies, simulations using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) produced reproducible results, but the simulations are tedious and involve assumptions. In this study, we propose machine‐learning models that can be used in tandem with CFD, to accelerate high‐fidelity fluid simulation, improve turbulence modeling, and enhance reduced‐order models. A two‐dimensional microwave‐driven plasma gasification reactor was developed in ANSYS (Ansys, Canonsburg, PA, USA) Fluent (a CFD tool), to create 644 (geometry and temperature) datasets for training six machine‐learning (ML) models. When fed with just geometry datasets, these ML models were able to predict the proportion of the reactor area with temperature above 2000 K. This temperature level is considered a benchmark to prevent formation of undesirable byproducts. The ML model that achieved highest prediction accuracy was the feed forward neural network; the mean absolute error was 0.011.

Balancing services are needed, which can be provided by virtual power plants (VPP) that aggregate distributed energy resources (DER) to consume or produce electricity on demand. Electric vehicle (EV) fleets can use idle cars' batteries as combined storage to offer balancing services on smart electricity markets. However, there are risks associated with this business model extension. The fleet faces severe imbalance penalties if it cannot charge the offered amount of balancing energy due to the vehicles' unpredicted mobility demand. Ensuring the fleet can fulfill all market commitments risks denying profitable customer rentals. We study the design of a decision support system that estimates these risks, dynamically adjusts the composition of a VPP portfolio, and profitably places bids on multiple electricity markets simultaneously. Here we show that a reinforcement learning agent can optimize the VPP portfolio by learning from favorable market conditions and fleet demand uncertainties. In comparison to previous research, in which the bidding risks were unknown and fleets could only offer conservative amounts of balancing power to a single market, our proposed approach increases the amount of offered balancing power by 48% to 82% and achieves a charging cost reduction of the fleet by 25%. In experiments with real-world carsharing data of 500 EVs, we found that mobility demand forecasting algorithms' accuracy is crucial for a successful bidding strategy. Moreover, we show that recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning decrease the convergence time and improve the results' robustness. Our results demonstrate how modern RL algorithms can be successfully used for fleet management, VPP optimization, and demand response in the smart grid. We anticipate that DER, such as EVs, will play an essential role in providing reliable backup power for the grid and formulate market design recommendations to allow easier access to these resources. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","distributed energy resources; electric vehicle; machine learning; optimization; reinforcement learning; virtual power plants","Cost reduction; Decision support systems; Deep learning; Digital storage; E-learning; Electric automobiles; Electric power plants; Electric power transmission networks; Power markets; Reinforcement learning; Renewable energy resources; Storage as a service (STaaS); Conservative amount; Demand forecasting; Distributed energy resource; Profitable customer; Reinforcement learning agent; Renewable energy source; Virtual power plants; Virtual power plants (VPP); Fleet operations","M.

In this paper, we propose LOSISH, a price-based Demand Response (DR) system for load scheduling in residential Smart Homes (SHs) that achieves a trade-off between electricity payments and consumer's discomfort. Our proposed system considers Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) and Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV). We formulate our scheduling as a constrained optimization problem and we propose a new hybrid algorithm to solve it. The latter combines two well known heuristic algorithms: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). Moreover, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on Machine Learning (ML) to extract consumer's preferences from a real dataset that contains the historical consumption patterns of his smart appliances. We test our approach on real data traces obtained from a SH and we set up an experiment to evaluate our algorithm on a Raspberry Pi and measure its energy consumption. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we compare our results with another approach from the literature in terms of electricity bill, Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR), energy consumption, and execution time. Numerical results show that LOSISH outperforms the other approach in terms of electricity bill (up to 52.92% cheaper), PAR (up to 44% decrease in peak demands), energy consumption (up to 69.44% less consumption), and execution time (up to 63.15% faster). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Clustering; Demand response; Energy storage system; Heuristic optimization; Plugin electric vehicle; Renewable energy sources; Smart grids","Automation; Clustering algorithms; Constrained optimization; Demand side management; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Heuristic algorithms; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Renewable energy resources; Scheduling; Smart power grids; Clusterings; Demand response; Energy storage system; Heuristic optimization; Plug-ins; Plugin electric vehicle; Renewable energy source; Smart grid; Smart homes; Storage systems; algorithm; alternative energy; cluster analysis; data set; demand analysis; electric vehicle; electricity supply; energy storage; modernization; optimization; smart grid; Energy utilization","B.

The fault characteristics of these generators depend on the inverters’ control strategy, which matters in the detection and classification of the fault. This paper presents a comprehensive machine-learning-based approach for detecting and classifying faults in transmission lines connected to inverter-based generators. A two-layer classification approach was considered: fault detection and fault type classification. The faults were comprised of different types at several line locations and variable fault impedance. The features from instantaneous three-phase current and voltages and calculated swing-center voltage (SCV) were extracted in time, frequency, and time–frequency domains. A photovoltaic (PV) and a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) wind farm plant were the considered renewable resources. The unbalanced data problem was investigated and mitigated using the synthetic minority class oversampling technique (SMOTE). The hyperparameters of the evaluated classifiers, namely decision trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Ensemble trees, were optimized using the Bayesian optimization algorithm. The extracted features were reduced using several methods. The classification performance was evaluated in terms of the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and precision metrics. The results show that the data balancing improved the specificity of DT, SVM, and k-NN classifiers (DT: from 99.86% for unbalanced data to 100% for balanced data; SVM: from 99.28% for unbalanced data to 99.93% for balanced data; k-NN: from 99.64% for unbalanced data to 99.74% for balanced data). The forward feature selection combined with the Bag ensemble classifier achieved 100% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision for fault detection (binary classification), while the Adaboost ensemble classifier had the highest accuracy (99.4%), compared to the other classifiers when using the complete set of features. The classification models with the highest performance were further tested using a new dataset test case. They showed high detection and classification capabilities. The proposed approach was compared with the previous methodologies from the literature. © 2022 by the authors.","Bayesian optimization; fault classification; fault detection; inverter-based generators; machine learning; power system protection; renewable energy","Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Electric equipment protection; Electric fault currents; Electric inverters; Electric lines; Electric power transmission; Fault detection; Forestry; Learning systems; Nearest neighbor search; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Text processing; Wind power; Bayesian optimization; Fault classification; Faults detection; Inverte-based generator; Inverter-based; Machine-learning; Power system protection; Renewable energies; Support vectors machine; Unbalanced data; Decision trees","K.

Data-driven optimization can improve their economic and environmental performance and their macro-projection can help in the achievement of net-zero plans. This article extends the use of a framework containing the usage of data modeling and artificial intelligence to conduct different optimization scenarios of the geothermal-driven energy system. It includes the improvement of the economic, exergetic, energetic, and environmental performance through the development of various optimization scenarios. This is done through the development of an extensive thermodynamic model and validation based upon energy, exergy, economic, and environmental evaluations. Different machine learning techniques are adapted for digital twinning of the six performance indicators as a function of nine design variables including operational, source, and economic variables. It is shown that the artificial neural network offers the best statistical fit as compared to the other machine learning techniques including RMSE: 0.1768, R2:0.9999, MSE:0.0312, and MAE:0.1107 for the total work output. Energy-efficient design has yielded a total work output of 1044.86 kW, with a first law efficiency of 0.3322. The economic design offers the lowest cost of electricity at only 34.004 $/hr.

A common approach to optimizing revenues of a hybrid hydro and energy storage system is using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Although MILP models can provide accurate production cost estimations, they are typically very computationally expensive. To provide a fast yet accurate first-step information to hydropower plant owners or operators who consider integrating energy storage systems, we propose an innovative approach to predicting optimal revenues of an integrated energy generation and storage system. In this study, we examined the performance of two prediction techniques: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and machine learning (ML) models developed based on artificial neural networks (ANN). Predictive equations and models are generated based on optimized solutions from a market participation optimization model, the Conventional Hydropower Energy and Environmental Resource System (CHEERS) model. The two predicting techniques reduce the computational time to evaluate annual revenue for one set of battery configurations from 3 h to 1 to 4 min per run while also being implementable with significantly less data. The model validation prediction errors of developed GAMs and ML models are generally below 5%; for model testing predictions, the ML models consistently outperform the regression equations in terms of root mean square errors. This new approach allows plant owners, operators, or potential investors to quickly access multiple battery configurations under different energy generation and market scenarios. This new revenue prediction method will therefore help reduce the barriers, and thereby promoting the deployment of battery hybridization with existing renewable energy sources. © 2022","Decision making; Energy storage; Hydropower; Machine learning; Renewable energy","Battery storage; Commerce; Costs; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Forecasting; Hydroelectric power; Integer programming; Investments; Machine learning; Mean square error; Neural networks; Decisions makings; Energy generations; Financial performance; Generalized additive model; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Mixed integer linear; Operator decisions; Renewable energies; Storage systems; Decision making","Y.

Because of this fact, the researchers are working for a long time to generate electrical energy sources due to the intermittent nature of unconventional energy sources such as solar, wind geothermal, tidal, and biomass as a sustainable, cost-effective, and environ-mentally friendly alternative for conventional energy sources. These systems are interconnected and fulfill demands as well as energy storage, which subsequently formed a complex hybrid renewable energy system. Hence, forecasting of energy generationand sizing of the equipment are essential for the economic feasibility of a complex hybrid system, and also necessary for the design analysis. Methods: In this research article, the proposed Functional Link Convolutional Neural Network (FLCNN) is applied to forecast the energy generation from the hybrid solar and wind energy system. Also, the Jaya algorithm has been applied to find the optimal sizing of the solar and wind-based hybrid renewable energy system. Results & Discussion: The proposed method is simple in design and implementation, and it also reduces computational complexity and time.

Renewable energy sources, especially solar energy have been investigated for large-scale hydrogen production in thermochemical, electrochemical, or photochemical manners due to considerable greenhouse gas emissions from the conventional steam reforming of natural gas and oil-based feedstock. The solar steam methane reforming using molten salt (SSMR-MS) is superior due to its unlimited operation hours and lower total annualized cost (TAC). In this work, we extend the existing optimisation framework for optimal design of SSMR-MS in which machine learning techniques are employed to describe the relationship between solar-related cost and molten salt heat duty and establish relationships of TAC, hydrogen production rate and molten salt heat duty with independent input variables in the whole flowsheet based on 18,619 sample points generated using the Latin hypercube sampling technique. A hybrid global optimisation algorithm is adopted to optimise the developed model and generate the optimal design, which is validated in SAM and Aspen Plus V8.8. The computational results demonstrate that a significant reduction in TAC by 14.9 % ~ 15.1 %, and CO2 emissions by 4.4 % ~ 5.2 % can be achieved compared to the existing SSMR-MS.

However, they often fail to meet energy requirements in unfavorable weather conditions. The concept of Hybrid renewable energy resources addresses this issue by integrating both renewable and non-renewable energy resources to meet the required energy load. In this paper, an intelligent cost optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the use of renewable energy resources and minimum utilization of non-renewable energy resources to meet the energy requirement for a nanogrid infrastructure. An actual data set comprising information about the load and demand of utility grids is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed nanogrid energy management system. The objective function is formulated to manage the nanogrid operation and implemented using a variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) named recurrent PSO (rPSO). Firstly, rPSO algorithm minimizes the installation cost for nanogrid. Thereafter, the proposed NEMS ensures cost efficiency for the post-installation period by providing a daily operational plan and optimizing renewable resources. State-of-the-art optimization models, including Genetic Algorithm (GA), bat and different Mathematical Programming Language (AMPL) solvers, are used to evaluate the model.

However, two fundamental constraints exist that preclude widespread adoption: the availability of the generated power and the expense of the equipment. One of the most critical difficulties with this sort of hybrid system is to appropriately design the Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) elements so that they fulfill all load requirements while requiring the least amount of investment and running expenditures. This research proposes a novel technique for evaluating the optimal smart grid linking Hybrid Renewable Energy (Solar photovoltaic and wind) with battery, to increase profitability, dependability, and feasibility. A multiobjective function is suggested and constructed to be optimized utilizing two optimization algorithms: Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm with Fuzzy-Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The primary goal for the HRES is to operate optimally to reduce the cost of energy generat ion through hourly day-ahead. Here, the Fuzzy-ELM is utilized to predict the required load of the smart grid-connected system and hybrid EPSO-HHO, which are introduced to solve the problem of HRES economic analysis. Finally, the suggested EPSO-EHO method is implemented in the MATLAB software, and its performance comparison is made with other existing methods such as PSO, WOA, and HHO. The simulation result shows that the cost of the newly suggested EPSO-HHO technique-based Hybrid Renewable Energy System is less than PSO, WOA, and HHO by 4.89 %, 4.51 %, and 4.05 %, respectively.  © 2022 - IOS Press.

First, the study aims at developing and evaluating the proposed hybrid ML-TSO algorithm. To do so, the optimization technique is implemented to solve the classical optimal power flow problem (OPF), with an objective function formulated to minimize the total generation costs. Second, the hybrid ML-TSO is adapted to solve the probabilistic OPF problem by studying the impact of the unavoidable uncertainty of renewable energy sources (solar photovoltaic and wind turbines) and time-varying load profiles on the generation costs. The evaluation of the proposed solution method is examined and validated on IEEE 57-bus and 118-bus standard systems. The simulation results and comparisons confirmed the robustness and applicability of the proposed hybrid ML-TSO algorithm in solving the classical and probabilistic OPF problems. Meanwhile, a significant reduction in the generation costs is attained upon the integration of the solar and wind sources into the investigated power systems. © 2022 by the authors.","machine learning; probabilistic optimal power flow; renewable energy sources","","H.M.

The need for sustainable renewable energy systems is continually growing, given the situation of the world's energy supplies. Numerous similar systems, including photovoltaic solar collectors, biomass, and wind turbines are used for energy generation. The ocean energy generator system uses the magnetohydrodynamics transformation concept to convert kinetic energy to electrical energy. Similar to conventional generators, an ocean generator requires an applied magnetic field to generate current, making it a critical component of the system. To optimize the performance and efficiency of ocean generators, various devices utilizing superconducting magnets have been developed, including Hall current generators, rotating channels, rotating disc magnetohydrodynamics generators, and helicoid generators. However, these systems also involve complex heat, momentum, and mass transfer, which can be better understood through mathematical modeling. The similarity transformation are introduced to transform the mathematical model from partial differential equation system to ordinary differential equation system. By adopting this approach, the numerical solution is significantly simplified while still preserving numerous crucial physical aspects of the studied heat and material transport phenomena. The physical characteristics of sea waves are governed by the three variables of seawater: temperature, salinity, and pressure. Small dispersed particles also affect the generation of hydroelectric power from surface water. The behaviour of velocity, temperature, and salinity profile is observed for the variations of different parameters such as magnetic, Grashof number and heat source. The system is converted into an optimization problem and solved by a neural network procedure. The solutions are compared with reference solutions for validation. The errors, performance, testing and training data are also presented graphically. The data is typically visualized using histograms, line graphs, and other visual aids. This allows for easier comprehension and analysis of the data.  © 2013 IEEE.","Computational analysis; dynamic parameters; energy generator; heat transfer; hybridization; machine learning; magnetic field; neuro-computing; nonlinear systems","Graph theory; Hydroelectric generators; Hydroelectric power plants; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Learning systems; Magnetic fields; Mass transfer; Mathematical transformations; Oceanography; Ordinary differential equations; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Surface waters; Water waves; Wind turbines; Computational analysis; Convection; Dynamic parameters; Energy; Energy generator; Generator; Heating system; Hybridisation; Machine-learning; Magnetic-field; Neurocomputing; Ocean temperature; Salinity (geophysical); Sea surfaces; Magnetohydrodynamic converters","A.N.

A prediction model with high accuracy and low computational load is required because the performance of model predictive control typically depends on it. Further, to facilitate its extensive use in common buildings, it is necessary to develop a simple modeling method that requires no expertise.

This concept allows for greater use of renewable energy while utilizing less input energy than conventional heating and cooling techniques. The proposed system consists of a reversible water-to-water heat pump driven by low-temperature geothermal energy. A rule-based control strategy is developed to establish an intelligent connection with the regional energy grids for peak shaving and compensating for the building's energy costs over the year. The dynamic simulation is carried out for a multi-family building complex in Stockholm, Sweden, using TRNSYS. The most favorable operating condition is determined via an artificial neural network-assisted tri-objective optimizer based on the grey wolf algorithm in MATLAB. The comparison of the proposed smart model with the conventional system in Sweden results in 332%, 203%, and 190% primary energy reduction, cost saving, and carbon dioxide emission mitigation, respectively. As indicated by the parametric results, the conflicting fluctuation between desirable and unfavorable indicators highlights the importance of multi-objective optimization. The grey wolf optimizer obtains 12% higher efficiency, 1.2 MWh lower annual bought energy, 24 $/MWh lower unit cost, and 5.1 MWh more yearly sold energy than the design condition. The scattered distribution reveals that tank volume and subcooling degree are sensitive parameters. According to the transient results, the suggested smart system can independently satisfy the building's heating, cooling, and electricity demands for more than 81% of the year, thanks to the two-way connection with the electricity and heating networks via the rule-based controller. © 2022 The Author(s)","Geothermal; Heat pump; High-temperature cooling; Low-temperature heating; Multi-objective optimization; Smart energy system","Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Geothermal energy; Geothermal heat pumps; Global warming; Machine learning; MATLAB; Neural networks; Temperature; Geothermal; Gray wolves; Heat pumps; Heating temperatures; High temperature cooling; Low temperature heating; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimizers; Rule based; Smart energy systems; Multiobjective optimization","A.

However, the inconsistent power profile of RES influences the power flow of the entire distribution network, so it is crucial to optimize the power flow in order to achieve stable and reliable operation. Therefore, this paper proposes a newly developed circle search algorithm (CSA) for the optimal solution of the probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF). Our research began with the development and evaluation of the proposed CSA. Firstly, we solved the OPF problem to achieve minimum generation fuel costs; this used the classical OPF. Then, the newly developed CSA method was used to deal with the probabilistic power flow problem effectively. The impact of the intermittency of solar and wind energy sources on the total generation costs was investigated. Variations in the system’s demands are also considered in the probabilistic OPF problem scenarios. The proposed method was verified by applying it to the IEEE 57-bus and the 118-bus test systems. This study’s main contributions are to test the newly developed CSA on the OPF problem to consider stochastic models of the RESs, providing probabilistic modes to represent the RESs. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed CSA in solving the probabilistic OPF problem are evaluated by comparing it with other methods, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the hybrid machine learning and transient search algorithm (ML-TSO) under the same parameters. The comparative results showed that the proposed CSA is robust and applicable; as evidence, an observable decrease was obtained in the costs of the conventional generators’ operation, due to the penetration of renewable energy sources into the studied networks. © 2022 by the authors.","circle search algorithm; optimization; probabilistic OPF; solar energy; wind energy","Acoustic generators; Electric load flow; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural resources; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Solar energy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Circle search algorithm; Optimal power flow problem; Optimisations; Power flows; Probabilistic optimal power flows; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Search Algorithms; Techno-economics; Uncertainty; Wind power","H.M.

However, their inherent complexity often makes these simulations computationally prohibitive, despite the current computational power available nowadays. This problem is aggravated when considering renewable energy systems, which are subjected to intermittent weather conditions and must be operated in connection with a grid of variable demand. In that sense, the use of metamodels has shown immense potential in the simulation, analysis, and optimization of energy systems. Therefore, this review presents a comprehensive analysis of the extensive application of metamodeling techniques in energy systems. After conducting a careful search using the Scopus database while targeting a well-defined group of keywords, 474 articles published from 2013 to 2023 were obtained in the present literature review. With a rigorous filtering and screening process, the first pool of articles was reduced to 126. The resulting articles were then separated in two main groups, reviews and research articles. Each of these groups was further organized in terms of the energy system studied, as well as the applicability, machine learning technique and error indicator. The results indicate a steady and significant growth in the number of publications associated with energy systems and different types of metamodeling techniques. The reasons are arguably twofold, reduction of computational time provided by the metamodels and their good accuracy. Nevertheless, and as reported by other studies, the review also identified the need to develop a standardized method for evaluating the error analysis of these models and a comparison between their actual efficiency, which includes accuracy and time. Furthermore, no clear relation was found between specific types of metamodels and specific energy systems. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Artificial intelligence; digital twins; energy system; machine learning; metamodels; renewable energy; thermal science","E-learning; Learning algorithms; Renewable energy resources; Energy systems; Machine learning techniques; Machine-learning; Meta model; Metamodeling; Metamodeling techniques; Optimisations; Physics-based models; Renewable energies; Thermal science; Machine learning","A.R.

Against this background, technologies for water resource management and treatment have been developed steadily to meet the water demand targets. However, further advances are necessary for securing environmental and economic sustainability. The management of saline water and wastewater is one of the focus areas to tackle the problems of water scarcity and sustainability in the context of water desalination. Hybrid desalination is one of the most practical and efficient technologies that can afford environmental and economic sustainability. Hybridization of multiple processes maximizes the advantages of individual technologies and minimizes their drawbacks. The overall research on desalination and research on hybrid desalination, in particular, increased by a compound annual growth rate of 16.6% and 21.8%, respectively, from 2011 to 2020. Meanwhile, in 2020, 10.7% of scientific articles and reviews dealt with hybrid technologies. Moreover, the advances in hybrid technology are not limited to academic research; they have been widely implemented in the desalination industry. Reverse osmosis–multistage flash (RO-MSF) hybrid technology has been adopted for the largest desalination plant in the world, with a total water production of 1,036,000 m3/d in Ras Al-Khair, Saudi Arabia. The synergetic impacts of hybridization have various benefits depending on the desalination processes selected. In an RO-MSF system, the hybridization leads to additional water production with higher water recovery compared to a standalone RO system. Improvement in energy efficiency is another advantage of hybrid technologies as observed in the case of membrane distillation–adsorp-tion (MD-AD) hybrid system. However, the challenges of hybrid desalination technologies are the complexity of process design, optimization, and operations. In this paper, the case of a forward osmosis–membrane distillation (FO-MD) hybrid system is presented to identify the challenges and potential solutions for hybrid desalination technologies. An FO process is driven by the osmotic pressure difference between two streams and produces water across a hydrophilic polymeric membrane. By using a saline solution, known as the draw solu-tion, freshwater may be recovered from a targeted feed solution stream with relatively lower salin-ity. MD is a thermal membrane process that makes use of the difference in vapor pressure between hot and cold streams to transport water vapor across the membrane to a cold permeate solution. These two membrane processes (FO and MD) are selected to treat the produced water, which is a by-product in the oil and gas industry; produced water has extremely high salinity and complex organic composition and hence is one of the most challenging wastewater streams for water treat-ment. Since FO and MD employ two different energy potentials (i.e., osmotic and thermal ener-gies, respectively), hybridization allows maximizing the use of available energy in target streams (i.e., produced water). To solve the challenge of complexity of hybridization, a novel integrated membrane module was developed for an FO-MD hybrid system. To evaluate the performance of the FO-MD hybrid system for produced water treatment, syn-thetic produced water streams were prepared according to water quality references from a conventional oil and gas production facility. Separate FO and MD experiments were conducted to study the membrane-fouling phenomena of different produced water qualities. In addition, the FO-MD hybrid system is operated with varied combinations of produced water streams for sustainability evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate the great potential of the FO-MD hybrid system for sustainable produced water treatment. Long-term operation of the hybrid system and experiments with real produced water samples are necessary for scaling up and optimizing the technology. Investigating the water–energy nexus related to the desalination technologies integrated with renewable energy is one approach to broaden the applications of hybrid desalination tech-nologies. Such a study will emphasize the advantages of hybridization despite the complex challenges. The benefits of hybrid technologies in terms of greater water production, higher recovery, and cleaner water quality will be synergized with less energy consumption by their integration with renewable energy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI)-based process design, optimization, and control will be an important tool to address the complexity of hybrid desalination technologies and will provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges, for which the conventional experimental and theoretical studies are still limited. AI algorithms, such as machine learning and artificial neural network algorithms, are the leading approaches to the advancement of AI-assisted smart desalination. © 2022 Desalination Publications.

The energy crisis causes load demand with respect to electricity. The use of renewable energy sources plays a vital role in reducing the energy crisis and in reduction of CO2 emission. The use of solar energy is the major source of power in generation as this is the root cause for the development of wind, tides, etc. However, due to climatic condition the availability of PV sources varies from time to time. Hence it is essential to track the maximum source of energy by implementing different types of MPPT algorithms. However, use of MPPT algorithms has the limitation of using the same during partial shadow conditions. The issue of tracking power under partial shadow conditions can be resolved by implementing an intelligent optimization tracking algorithm which involves a computation process. Though many of nature’s inspired algorithms were present to address real world problems, Mirjalili developed the dragonfly algorithm to provide a better optimization solution to the issues faced in real-time applications. The proposed concept focuses on the implementation of the dragonfly optimization algorithm to track the maximum power from solar and involves the concept of machine learning, image processing, and data computation. © 2021 by the authors.

Critical issues related to optimization, provision of smart customizable networks and sophisticated computational techniques and methods enabled by artificial intelligence and machine learning need further investigation. The renewable energy (RE) is a powerful resource for the future global development in the context of climate change and resources depletion. Artificial intelligence (AI) implies new rules of organizing the activities in order to respond to these new requirements. It is necessary to improve the design of the energy infrastructure, the deployment and production of RE in order to face the multiple challenges that will affect the sector's growth and resilience..

Specifically, we introduce an additional predictive step that follows the standard online convex optimization step when certain conditions on the estimated gradient and descent direction are met. We show that under these conditions and without any assumptions on the predictability of the environment, the predictive update strictly improves on the performance of the standard update.

The proposed method consists of three main stages: database generation, supervised learning, and optimization using the created model. A database is first created of Probabilistic small-signal stability margin calculated using the combined cumulant and Gram-Charlier expansion and the parameters of damping controllers, which is then given to different supervised machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, support vector machine, random forest, and chiefly deep neural network to create a surrogate model. The surrogate model provides an approximate relationship between the probabilistic small-signal instability margin and damping controller parameters. An optimization problem is then formulated to minimize the surrogate probabilistic instability margin with damping controller parameters acting as constraints. Finally, this optimization problem is solved using the bat algorithm to obtain the optimized parameters for power oscillation damping controllers. Our study results tested on a large IEEE 16 machines, 68 bus system show that the power oscillation damping controllers optimized using the proposed method can largely improve the system low frequency oscillatory stability margin in a very low computational time (around 19 times faster than the conventional method).

To design a robust hybrid modelling mechanism, the Interim-ERA European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data are employed to train and cross-validate the estimation model that is formulated by an evolutionary-type algorithm: the Coral Reefs Optimization (CRO) integrated with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model. The hybrid CRO-(ELM) algorithm is applied in two stages: first for the feature selection process guided by an ELM algorithm (a class of fast training neural network tool) as the model's fitness function to screen an optimal set of predictor variables and second, for the estimation of the solar radiation using the optimally screened variables by the final hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system. To benchmark the performance of the hybrid CRO-ELM algorithm for this estimation problem we apply an alternative, yet a similar feature screening approach: the Grouping Genetic Algorithm encoded into the ELM-based model (GGA-(ELM) used as the predictor mechanism). After the feature selection process is performed by the CRO algorithm that extracts the data patterns for accurate estimation the alternative objective algorithm is applied (in this case the ELM again) to formulate the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM modelling system. To provide a rigorous evaluation of the CRO-(ELM)-ELM hybrid system, alternative estimation approaches are considered: the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and the Support Vector Regression (SVR). The hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system is tested in a real problem where the results are evaluated by means of several statistical score metrics and diagnostic plots of the observed and the estimated daily global solar radiation in the testing phase. We show that the hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM model is able to yield promising results; thus improving those attained by the 7 alternative models (i.e., hybrid CRO-(ELM)-MARS, CRO-(ELM)-MLR and CRO-(ELM)-SVR and the GGA equivalent models). The study ascertains that the CRO-based hybrid system where a large pool of predictor data are carefully screened through a wrapper-based modelling system and the ELM model is applied as a objective estimation tool can be adopted as a qualified stratagem in solar radiation estimation problems. The proposed hybrid CRO-(ELM)-ELM system exhibits clear advantages over the alternative machine learning approaches tested and also over the other machine learning algorithms used without the feature selection tool; thus advocating its scientific utility in renewable energy applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coral Reefs Optimization; Extreme Learning Machines; Grouping Genetic Algorithms; Hybrid modelling system; Solar radiation estimation","Australia; Queensland; Anthozoa; Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Feature extraction; Genetic algorithms; Hybrid systems; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Linear regression; Optimization; Radiation; Reefs; Regression analysis; Solar radiation; Weather forecasting; Coral reef; Extreme learning machine; Grouping genetic algorithms; Hybrid modelling; Solar radiation estimation; estimation method; genetic algorithm; machine learning; model validation; numerical model; optimization; solar power; solar radiation; Evolutionary algorithms","R.C.

To operate smart electricity grids, cooperation between grid-owned and third-party assets becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines machine learning with multi-objective optimization to accurately plan the exploitation of the energy district’s flexibility with the objective of reducing peak consumption and avoiding reverse power flow. Using historical data, acquired by the smart meters deployed on the pilot district, the district’s power profile can be predicted daily and analyzed to identify potentially critical issues on the network. District’s resources, such as electric vehicles, charging stations, photovoltaic panels, buildings energy management systems, and energy storage systems, have been modeled by taking into account their operational constraints and the multi-objective optimization has been adopted to identify the usage pattern that better suits the distribution operator’s (DSO) needs. The district is subject to incentives and penalties based on its ability to respond to the DSO request. Analysis of the results shows that this methodology can lead to a substantial reduction of both the reverse power flow and peak consumption. © 2020 by the authors.

A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR. Seasonal variations of PES, PEC, and GR are incorporated to remove hitches from seasonal dynamics of prosumers energy generation and prosumers energy consumption. The proposed adaptive Service Level Agreement (SLA) between energy prosumers and the grid benefits both these entities. The results of the proposed model are rigorously compared with conventional optimization (GA and PSO) based EMM to prove the validity of the proposed model. © 2018 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

In this regard, wind power is taking significant importance, worldwide. However, to acquire consistent power generation from wind, the expected wind power is required in advance. Consequently, various prediction models have been reported for wind power prediction. However, we observe that Support Vector Regression (SVR), and specially, a hybrid learning model based on SVR offer better performance and generalization compared to multiple linear regression (MLR) and is thus quite suitable for the development of short-term wind power prediction system. To this end, a new methodology ML-STWP namely Machine Learning based Short Term Wind Power Prediction is proposed for short-term wind power prediction. This approach utilizes a combination of machine learning (ML) techniques for feature selection and regression. The proposed methodology is thus a hybrid ML model, which makes use of feature selection through irrelevancy and redundancy filters, and then employs SVR for auxiliary prediction. Finally, the wind power is predicted using enhanced particle swarm optimization and a hybrid neural network. The wind power dataset on which the model is tuned and tested consists of real-time daily values of wind speed, relative humidity, temperature, and wind power.

In cases where multiple independently controlled cooling tower cells are used in parallel for the cooling purposes of such stations, there is an opportunity to increase plant efficiency through data-driven optimization across their full load ranges. This work presents a novel application of real-time optimization using machine learning and particle swarm optimization on a multi-cell induced-draft cooling tower servicing a coal-fired power station under variable load. This is the first work to demonstrate simultaneous optimization of a multi-cell cooling tower, in addition to using machine learning for closed-loop control on a cooling tower. A novel control configuration is presented that ensures original control logic is not adversely affected and that the overall plant process is not disrupted using only existing hardware and operational data. To verify this methodology, the 12 independent cooling tower cells are simulated in parallel using historic operating data to demonstrate the effectiveness of real-time optimization compared to current practice. An artificial neural network is trained to predict overall cooling tower power consumption using only operational data and ambient conditions with an R2 value of greater than 0.96. The real-time optimization using particle swarm yields 6.7% annual energy usage savings compared to current practices, although the extent of the real-time savings varies greatly with both plant load and environmental conditions. This is particularly significant for a variable load situation because frequent ramping typically results in reduced overall efficiency. This proposed AI-based solution presents an opportunity to improve the overall heat rate of a load-following coal-fired power plant without the need to perform extensive first-principles modeling or add additional hardware to the cooling tower, resulting in more resources conserved and less overall emissions per unit of electricity generated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cooling tower; Machine learning; Neural network; Particle swarm optimization; Real-time optimization; Supply-side management","Cells; Closed loop control systems; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Cooling; Cooling towers; Cytology; Electric substations; Energy utilization; Evaporative cooling systems; Fossil fuel power plants; Machine learning; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Swarm intelligence; Coal fired power station; Data-driven optimization; Environmental conditions; Evaporative cooling towers; First principles models; Load-following operation; Renewable energy penetrations; Simultaneous optimization; Electric power system stability","K.M.

However, SDHS technical barriers during their design and operation phases, combined with their economic limitation, promote a high variation in quantifying SDHS benefits over their lifetime. This study proposes a complete multi-objective optimization framework using a robust machine learning approach to inherent sustainability principles in the design of SDHS. Moreover, the framework investigates the uncertainty in the context of SDHS design, in which the Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is combined with the heuristics optimization approach. The framework application is illustrated through a case study for the optimal integration of SHDS at different urban community sizes (10, 25, 50, and 100 buildings) located in Madrid. The results reveal a substantial improvement in economic and environmental benefits for deploying SDHS, especially with including the seasonal storage tank (SST) construction properties in the optimization problem, and it can achieve a payback period up to 13.7 years. In addition, the solar fraction of the optimized SDHS never falls below 82.1% for the investigated community sizes with an efficiency above 69.5% for the SST. Finally, the GSA indicates the SST investment cost and its relevant construction materials, are primarily responsible for the variability in the optimal system feasibility. The proposed framework can provide a good starting point to solve the enormous computational expenses drawbacks associated with the heuristics optimization approach. Furthermore, it can function as a decision support tool to fulfill the European Union energy targets regarding clean energy production. © 2020 The Authors","Artificial Neural Network; Bayesian optimization approach; Global sensitivity analysis; Life cycle assessment; Multi-objective optimization; Solar assist district heating system","Madrid [Spain]; Spain; Building materials; Decision support systems; District heating; Heating equipment; Investments; Machine learning; Multiobjective optimization; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Decision support tools; Design and operations; Economic and environmental benefits; Global sensitivity analysis; Machine learning approaches; Optimization approach; Solar assisted district heating; Sustainability principles; design method; European Union; global perspective; heating; machine learning; power generation; sensitivity analysis; solar power; sustainability; urban area; Sensitivity analysis","D.

In this paper, a hybrid energy system consisting of photovoltaic (PV) system, hydrogen (long-term energy storage devices) and battery (short-term energy storage devices) is constructed. Coordinated control of the hybrid energy storage system can be formulated as sequential decision-making problem to be solved effectively with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method. Affected by multiple factors such as real-time power generation and load change, hybrid energy coordinated control is a complex optimization decision problem, where different solutions may affect system power supply stability, utilization efficiency and economic benefits. A deep reinforcement learning framework and a neural network model are designed to solve such problems. Real-time online decision and control can be realized with sufficient training, which compensates the shortcomings of traditional methods in this respect. At the same time, it can be effectively processed for different moments, weather and seasonal scenarios. The results show feasibility and effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning in the hybrid energy coordination control, making this paper both of academic significance and engineering value, and this method can be adopted to solve similar problems. © 2019, Power System Technology Press.

To reduce the high dependence of RE resources on the change of weather conditions, a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) is introduced in this research, especially for an isolated microgrid. In HRES, solar and wind energies are the primary energy resources while the battery and fuel cells (FCs) are considered as the storage systems that supply energy in case of insufficiency. Moreover, a diesel generator is adopted as a back-up system to fulfill the load demand in the event of a power shortage. This study focuses on the development of HRES with the combination of battery and hydrogen FCs. Three major parts were considered including optimal sizing, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control, and the energy management system (EMS). Recent developments and achievements in the fields of machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) have led to new challenges and opportunities for HRES development. Firstly, the optimal sizing of the hybrid renewable hydrogen energy system was defined based on the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software for the case study in an island in the Philippines. According to the assessment of EMS and MPPT control of HRES, it can be concluded that RL is one of the most emerging optimal control solutions. Finally, a hybrid perturbation and observation (P & O) and Q-learning (h-POQL) MPPT was proposed for a photovoltaic (PV) system. It was conducted and validated through the simulation in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that it showed better performance in comparison to the P & O method. © 2019 by the authors.","EMS and reinforcement learning; HRES; MPPT control; Optimal sizing","","Y.-C.

Real-time states monitoring and data processing of IoT nodes are of great significance, but the processing power of IoT devices is limited. Using the emerging mobile edge computing (MEC), IoT devices can offload computing tasks to an MEC server associated with small or macro base stations. Moreover, the use of renewable energy harvesting capabilities in base stations or IoT nodes may reduce energy consumption. As wireless channel conditions vary with time and the arrival rates of renewable energy, computing tasks are stochastic, and data offloading and renewable energy aware for IoT devices under a dynamic and unknown environment are major challenges. In this work, we design a data offloading and renewable energy aware model considering an MEC server performing multiple stochastic computing tasks and involving time-varied wireless channels. To optimize data transmission delay, energy consumption, and bandwidth allocation jointly, and to avoid the curse of dimensionality caused by the complexity of the action space, we propose a joint optimization method for data offloading, renewable energy aware, and bandwidth allocation for IoT devices based on deep reinforcement learning (JODRBRL), which can handle the continuous action space. JODRBRL can minimize the total system cost(including data buffer delay cost, energy consumption cost, and bandwidth cost) and obtain an efficient solution by adaptively learning from the dynamic IoT environment. The numerical results demonstrate that JODRBRL can effectively learn the optimal policy, which outperforms Dueling DQN, Double DQN (DDQN), and greedy policy in stochastic environments. © 2019 IEEE.","Data offloading; deep reinforcement learning; energy aware; mobile edge computing","Bandwidth; Base stations; Data handling; Deep learning; Edge computing; Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Green computing; Machine learning; Power management; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Curse of dimensionality; Data offloading; Energy aware; Internet of Things (IOT); Reduce energy consumption; Reinforcement learning approach; Use of renewable energies; Wireless channel condition; Internet of things","J.

However, owing to the volatility and intermittency of RE, it is challenging to design an accurate and reliable short-term load forecasting model. Recently, machine learning (ML) based forecasting models have been applied for short-term load forecasting whereas most of them ignore the importance of characteristics mining, parameters fine-tuning, and forecasting stability. To dissolve the above issues, a short-term load forecasting model is proposed that incorporates thorough data mining and multi-step rolling forecasting. To alleviate the chaos of short-term load, a de-noising method based on decomposition and reconstruction is used. Then, a phase space reconstruction (PSR) method is employed to dynamically determine the train-test ratios and neurons settings of the artificial neural network (ANN). Further, a multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm (MOGOA) is applied to optimize the parameters of ANNs. Case studies are conducted in the urban smart grid systems of Victoria and New South Wales in Australia. Simulation results show that the proposed model can forecast short-term load well with various measurement metrics. Multiple criterion and statistical evaluation also show the good performance of the proposed forecasting model in terms of accuracy and stability. To conclude, the proposed model achieves high accuracy and robustness, which will provide references to RE transitions and smart grid optimization, and offer guidance to sustainable city development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Multi-objective optimization algorithm; Neural networks; Short-term load forecasting; Smart grid; Urban sustainability","Data mining; Electric power plant loads; Electric power transmission networks; Forecasting; Fossil fuels; Multiobjective optimization; Neural networks; Object oriented programming; Phase space methods; Urban growth; Decomposition and reconstruction; Forecasting modeling; Optimization algorithms; Phase space reconstructions (PSR); Short term load forecasting; Smart grid; Statistical evaluation; Urban sustainability; accuracy assessment; alternative energy; artificial neural network; data mining; decomposition analysis; design; forecasting method; fossil fuel; machine learning; parameterization; reconstruction; smart grid; sustainability; Smart power grids","","","Elsevier Ltd","03062619","","APEND","","English","Appl.

In this study, a deep neural network with a modified early stopping algorithm and least square support vector machine were developed to predict SOx and NOx emissions associated with coal conversion in energy production. The models were trained on commercial plant data and the effect of dynamic coal and limestone properties (which is assumed constant in the literature) such as proximate analysis, ultimate analysis and particle size distribution on prediction accuracy were investigated. The results revealed that training the models without the assumptions improved the accuracy of the testing phase by at least 10% and 40% with a coefficient of efficiency of 0.8925 and 0.9904 for SOx and NOx respectively. In addition, interactive and pairwise correlation featuring were implemented which gave a maximum computational time reduction of 46.67% for NOx emission prediction.

However, the inherent fluctuation of renewable generations adds significant uncertainty to the supply side of microgrid. On the other hand, due to the small scale of the microgrid, the load demand in microgrid also has higher uncertainty than that observed in utility grids. Furthermore, the supply uncertainty and demand uncertainty may have different distribution characteristics, e.g., Gaussian and non-Gaussian uncertainties may exist simultaneously. These uncertainties pose significant challenges to the microgrid energy management. To address these challenges, this paper establishes a new stochastic energy scheduling scheme for microgrids. In this scheme, the energy scheduling is formulated as a stochastic model predictive control problem, which incorporates the uncertainties in both sides of supply and demand. Using machine-learning techniques, the corresponding stochastic optimization problem is converted to a standard convex quadratic programming, and thus can be solved efficiently. A key feature of this scheme is that it handles the coexistence of Gaussian and non-Gaussian uncertainties. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Energy storage; Microgrid; Model predictive control; Renewable energy; Stochastic programming","Economics; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning systems; Model predictive control; Quadratic programming; Scheduling; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Convex quadratic programming; Different distributions; Energy storage systems; Machine learning techniques; Non-gaussian uncertainties; Renewable generation; Scheduling schemes; Stochastic optimization problems; Stochastic models","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","19328184","","","","English","IEEE Syst.

It is particularly essential to built dependability and accessibility of wind turbines and additional to decrease the wind energy cost. Wind turbine blades are ought to be an important component among the other basic segments in the wind turbine framework since they transform the dynamic energy of wind into useable power. Wind turbine blades are manufactured from either carbon fiber reinforced polymer or glass fiber reinforced polymer. Damages and flaws are unavoidable either in the manufacturing process or the lifetime of a composite blade. Hence, structural health monitoring for wind turbine blade is essential to avoid failures and extend dependability in both fabrication quality control and in-service investigation. In this study, a three-bladed variable wind turbine was chosen and using histogram features, the condition of a wind turbine blade is inspected. The faults like hub-blade loose connection, blade crack, pitch angle twist, erosion and blade bend faults were studied and these faults are classified using various data mining algorithms. The main contribution of this study is to build and suggest a data-model for fault identification on wind turbine blade while in operation using machine learning classifiers like sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm, simple logistic algorithm (SLA), multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic algorithm (LA) and radial basis function (RBF). © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.","Fault diagnosis; Histogram features; Machine learning; Structural health monitoring; Vibration signals; Wind turbine blade","","V.

White box models, using linear and mixed integer linear programing techniques, are often used in their design. However, the increased complexity of energy flow (especially due to cyber-physical interactions) and uncertainties challenge the application of white box models. This is where data driven methodologies become effective, as they demonstrate higher flexibility to adapt to different environments, which enables their use for energy planning at regional and national scale. This study introduces a data driven approach based on reinforcement learning to design distributed energy systems. Two different neural network architectures are used in this work, i.e. a fully connected neural network and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The novel approach introduced is benchmarked using a grey box model based on fuzzy logic. The grey box model showed a better performance when optimizing simplified energy systems, however it fails to handle complex energy flows within the energy system. Reinforcement learning based on fully connected architecture outperformed the grey box model by improving the objective function values by 60%. Reinforcement learning based on CNN improved the objective function values further (by up to 20% when compared to a fully connected architecture). The results reveal that data-driven models are capable to conduct design optimization of complex energy systems.

However, the wind speed has inherent fluctuation, and accurate wind speed prediction is challenging. This paper aims to propose a hybrid forecasting approach of short-term wind speed based on a novel signal processing algorithm, a wrapper-based feature selection method, the state-of-art optimization algorithm, ensemble learning, and an efficient artificial neural network. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) is employed to decompose the original wind time-series into sublayer modes. The binary bat algorithm (BBA) is used to complete the feature selection. Bayesian optimization (BO) fine-tuned online sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) is proposed to forecast the low-frequency sublayers of VMD. Bagging-based ensemble OSELM is proposed to forecast high-frequency sublayers of VMD. Two experiments were conducted on 10 min datasets from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The performances of the proposed model were compared with various representative models. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model has better accuracy than the comparison models. Among the thirteen models, the proposed VMD-BBA-EnsOSELM model can obtain the best prediction accuracy, and the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) is always less than 0.09.

This may be achieved if the solar radiation is predicted well in advance. Meteorological stations have radiation measuring devices like pyranometer, pyrheliometer, radiometer, solarimeter, etc. however, it may not be available at the location of interest for researchers. Due to this limitation solar radiation estimation models are devised based on location details like Altitude, Latitude, Longitude, and metrological details like Wind Speed, Ambient Temperature, Relative Humidity, Day Temperature, etc. These radiation models provide Global Solar Radiation (GSR) as output. These models are statistically tested based on error calculation like Mean Bias Error, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, etc. This paper is framed to briefly provide the idea behind different solar radiation estimation models with the methodology used. Soft computing-based models are mainly analyzed here. ANN-based Global Solar Irradiance Estimation Model has been developed using geographical parameters like Elevation, Latitude, Longitude, Longitude, and meteorological parameters like Months of a year, Days of a month, Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure, Relative Humidity, and Wind Speed. The data are downloaded from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) for 2014 (latest available). From this paper, the reader will come to know about various techniques used in solar radiation estimation. The developed ANN-based model has better results for training, testing, validation, and all with Regression value of 0.94304, 0.9488, 0.94766, 0.94556 respectively. The MSE is found to be 0.0089147 at epoch 0. The obtained values of R and MSE indicates the suitability of the developed model. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

Various studies have been conducted on the prediction of renewable energy performance using machine learning techniques. In this study, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was utilized in predicting photovoltaic (PV) power generation. An RNN is an artificial neural network in which the connection between units is composed of a cyclic structure that can reflect the characteristics of time series. Therefore, to eventually incorporate a model predictive control technique for energy demand and supply matching, this study uses previously measured weather data and PV power generation data to predict the future PV power generation. Various optimization processes, such as normalization, classification of learning data, and setting of layer options, are performed to create a predictive model. Furthermore, 500 hidden neurons and 1 and 3 hidden layers are created and compared. The initial learning rate for both single and multiple-layer options was set to 0.05. As a result, the coefficient of variation of the root mean squared error, Cv(RMSE), which is a statistical index to assess the overall accuracy of the predicted values, was 13.8 % for a single layer and 13.2 % for a multiple-layer long short term memory model. Although no significant difference was observed between the two models, the multiple-layer model showed a slightly reduced error rate than the single-layer model, and the accurate prediction was confirmed to be achievable. Based on this study, a stable energy supply system can be established through linkage with energy storage control by predicting the amount of energy production through renewable energy sources and the amount of energy demand at urban scale. © 2021, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Deep learning; Model predictive control; PV power generation; Recurrent neural network; Renewable energy","Deep learning; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Forecasting; Information management; Learning systems; Mean square error; Model predictive control; Photovoltaic cells; Predictive analytics; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Three term control systems; Coefficient of variation; Energy supply system; Machine learning techniques; Predictive modeling; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Renewable energy source; Root mean squared errors; Single-layer models; Long short-term memory","K.H.

Thereafter, the importance of energy systems with flexible dispatch is reinforced, ensuring energy storage as an essential asset for these systems to be able to balance production and demand. In order to do so, such systems should participate in wholesale energy markets, enabling competition among all players, including conventional power plants. Consequently, an effective dispatch schedule considering market and resource uncertainties is crucial. In this context, an innovative dispatch optimization strategy for schedule planning of renewable systems with storage is presented. Based on an optimization algorithm combined with a machine-learning approach, the proposed method develops a financial optimal schedule with the incorporation of uncertainty information. Simulations performed with a concentrated solar power plant model following the proposed optimization strategy demonstrate promising financial improvement with a dynamic and intuitive dispatch planning method (up to 4% of improvement in comparison to an approach that does not consider uncertainties), emphasizing the importance of uncertainty treatment on the enhanced quality of renewable systems scheduling. © 2020 by the authors.

This has brought a serious problem to the power industry regarding the management of power grids containing a significant penetration of wind power. Therefore, a highly accurate wind power forecast is very useful for operating these power grids effectively and sustainably. In this study, a new dual-step integrated machine learning (ML) model based on the hybridization of wavelet transform (WT), ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO), and feedforward artificial neural network (FFANN) is devised for a 24 h-ahead wind energy generation forecast. The devised model consists of dual steps. The first step uses environmental factors (weather variables) to estimate wind speed at the installation point of the wind generation system. The second step fits the wind farm actual generation with the actual wind speed observation at the location of the farm. The predicted future speed in the first step is later given to the second step to estimate the future generation of the farm. The devised method achieves significantly acceptable and promising forecast accuracy. The forecast accuracy of the devised method is evaluated through several criteria and compared with other ML based models and persistence based reference models. The daily mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), the normalized mean absolute error (NMAE), and the forecast skill (FS) values achieved by the devised method are 4.67%, 0.82%, and 56.22%, respectively. The devised model outperforms all the evaluated models with respect to various performance criteria. © 2019 by the authors.","Ant colony optimization; Feedforward artificial neural network; Forecasting; Machine learning; Renewable energy; Wavelet transform; Wind energy","","M.-Y.

In this work, several regression tools are analyzed using larger datasets for urban area electrical load forecasting. The regression tools which are used are Random Forest Regressor, k-Nearest Neighbour Regressor and Linear Regressor. This work explores the use of regression tool for regional electric load forecasting by correlating lower distinctive categorical level (season, day of the week) and weather parameters. The regression analysis has been done on continuous time basis as well as vertical time axis approach. The vertical time approach is considering a sample time period (e.g seasonally and weekly) of data for four years and has been tested for the same time period for the consecutive year. This work has uniqueness in electrical demand forecasting using regression tools through vertical approach and it also considers the impact of meteorological parameters. This vertical approach uses less amount of data compare to continuous time-series as well as neural network techniques. A correlation study, where both the Pearson method and visual inspection, of the vertical approach depicts meaningful relation between pre-processing of data, test methods and results, for the regressors examined through Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By examining the structure of various regressors they are compared for the lowest MAPE.

In the literature, most EMSs proposed are based on the implementation of energy systems prediction which enable to run a specific optimization algorithm. Such strategy, known as Rolling Time Horizon (RTH), demonstrated very effective when the supporting prediction system performs well. However, it is featured by high operational times. In this work, different lightweight EMS models synthesized through machine learning algorithms have been compared considering six different simulation scenarios. Results shows that an RTH-based EMS owns the best overall performances. However, in some case studies, also other EMSs show competitive results, especially those based on Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) trained by clustering, which in one case outperform RTH EMSs, and in other 3 cases (out of 6) yields performances close to RTH EMSs within 5%. A second contribution concerns the RTH EMS implementation on a small micro-controller, highlighting the high computational effort which can range in the order of minutes. Conversely, the ANFIS EMS shows always almost negligible computational costs (less than one second) and therefore can be used in realistic scenarios on cheap devices at run time. The paper also proposed a novel graphic tool to better represent, observe and analyze microgrid energy flows in each time slot or along the overall considered dataset. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ANFIS; Dynamic programming; Energy management systems; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Microgrids; Neural networks; Support vector machine","Automation; Energy management; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Intelligent buildings; Intelligent computing; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Microgrids; Real time systems; Renewable energy resources; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Computational costs; Computational effort; Computational intelligence techniques; Multi-energy systems; Optimization algorithms; Renewable energy source; Rolling time horizons; algorithm; alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy resource; fuzzy mathematics; machine learning; optimization; performance assessment; simulation; Energy management systems","S.

In this study, we attempt to forecast the wind power data collected from the Mai Liao Wind Farm. Our forecast model is based on a Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP) model using the data collected at the Mai Liao Wind Farm over a period of five years from September 2002 to August 2007. We proposed a new algorithm, namely improved Simplified Swarm Optimization (iSSO), which improves Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO) by justifying the weights and bias in training the MLP. The proposed iSSO combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autocorrelation Function (AF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PAF) for the selection of features which increases the efficiency of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of iSSO outperforms the other six most popular algorithms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Derivative-free optimization is integrated with an ensemble of sequence-to-sequence networks to design a new resampling technique called additive resampling to exploit the repetitive behavior of time series, particularly the characteristics of renewable energy. The performance of the proposed framework is explored on three renewable energy sources—wind, solar and ocean wave—on which several short-to long-term forecasts are conducted to show the superiority of the proposed method compared to numerous machine learning techniques. The findings indicate that the introduced method performs more accurately when the forecasting horizon becomes longer. In addition, the framework for automated feature selection is modified.

The use of storage systems enables the decoupling of energy demand and supply and to consider dynamic constraints in the control of the systems. The resulting optimization problem is very challenging to solve with the state-of-the-art rule-based-control (RBC) approach. Model Predictive Control (MPC) on the other hand allows a nearly optimal operation but comes with expensive modeling efforts and high computational costs. These drawbacks are contrasted by promising results from the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL can be model-free, is highly adaptive and learns a policy by interacting with the controlled system. However, the literature also addresses a number of questions, to be answered before RL for BACS can be realized. One is the slow convergence of the training process, which makes the application of a pre-training strategy necessary. Therefore, we design and compare different pre-training work-flows for a real-world energy system, in a demand response scenario. We apply a data-driven approach, covering all aspects from raw monitoring data to the trained algorithm. The considered energy system consists of two compression chillers and an ice storage. The objective of the control task is to charge and discharge the storage with respect to dynamic constraints. We use machine learning models of the energy system to train and evaluate a state-of-the-art RL algorithm (DQN) under five different pre-training strategies. We compare, online and offline training and initialization of the RL controller together with a guiding RBC. We demonstrate that offline training with a guiding RBC provides stable learning and a RL controller that always outperforms this guiding RBC. Unguided exploration on the other hand leads to higher accumulated cost savings. Based on our findings, we derive recommendations for practical application and future research questions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Building automation and control; Data-driven modeling; Demand response; Machine learning; Offline training; Reinforcement Learning; Thermal energy systems","Controllers; Digital storage; Model predictive control; Monitoring; Predictive control systems; Reinforcement learning; Thermal energy; Building automation and controls; Data driven modelling; Demand response; Energy systems; Learning controllers; Machine-learning; Off-line training; Reinforcement learnings; Rule-based control; Thermal energy systems; Intelligent buildings","T.

Thus the estimation of wind power density based on empirical models demand subsequent data processing to ensure accuracy and reliability in energy computations. Present study analyses the reliability of the ANN-based machine learning approach in predicting wind power density for five stations (Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Salem, and Tirunelveli) in the state of Tamil Nadu, India using five different non-linear models.

By integrating heat from several heat generators and a high proportion of different renewable energies, they also have a high degree of flexibility. Optimizing the operation of such systems is a complex task due to the diversity of producers, the use of storage systems with stratified charging and continuous changes in system properties. Besides, it is necessary to consider conflicting economic and ecological targets. Operational optimization of district heating systems using nonlinear models is underrepresented in practice and science. Considering ecological and economic targets, the current work focuses on developing a procedure for an operational optimization, which ensures a continuous optimal operation of the heat and power generators of a local heating network. The approach presented uses machine learning methods, including Gaussian process regressions for a repeatedly updated multi-stage approximation of the nonlinear system behavior. For the formation of the approximation models, a selection algorithm is utilized to choose only essential and current process data. By using a global optimization algorithm, a multi-objective optimal setting of the controllable variables of the system can be found in feasible time. Implemented in the control system of a dynamic simulation, significant improvements of the target variables (operating costs, CO2 emissions) can be seen in comparison with a standard control system. The investigation of different scenarios illustrates the high relevance of the presented methodology. © 2020 by the authors.

Several methods of analyses including metaheuristic optimization algorithms, artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning algorithms are being developed and used. Predictive ML models for two modified IEEE 14-bus and IEEE-30 bus systems, integrated with renewable energy sources (solar and wind) and reactive power compensative device (STATCOM) are proposed and developed with features that include hour of the day, solar irradiation, wind velocity, dynamic grid price and system load. An hour-wise input database for the model development is generated from monthly average data and hour-wise daily curves with normally distributed standard deviations. The data feasibility tests and output database generation is performed using MATLAB. Linear and higher order polynomial regression models are developed for the 8760hr database using Python 3.0 in JupyterLab and a best-fit predictive ML model is identified by analysing the coefficients of determination. The voltage stability and cost predictive ML models were tested for a 24hr input profile. The results obtained and the comparison with the expected values are furnished.

These techniques autonomously control heating and domestic hot water systems, which are the most relevant loads in a dwelling, helping consumers to reduce energy consumption and also improving their comfort. Moreover, the number of houses equipped with renewable energy resources is increasing, and this is a key element for energy usage optimization, where coordinating loads and production can bring additional savings and reduce peak loads. In this regard, we propose the development of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for indoor and domestic hot water temperature control, aiming to reduce energy consumption by optimizing the usage of PV energy production. Furthermore, a methodology for a new dynamic indoor temperature setpoint definition is presented, thus allowing greater flexibility and savings. The results show that the proposed DRL algorithm combined with the dynamic setpoint achieved on average 8% of energy savings compared to a rule-based algorithm, reaching up to 16% of savings over the summer period. Moreover, the users’ comfort has not been compromised, as the algorithm is calibrated to not exceed more than 1% of the time out the specified temperature setpoints. Additional analysis shows that further savings could be achieved if the time out of comfort is increased, which could be agreed according to users’ needs. Regarding demand side management, the DRL control shows efficiency by anticipating and delaying actions for a PV self-consumption optimization, performing over 10% of load shifting. Finally, the renewable energy consumption is 9.5% higher for the DRL-based model compared to the rule-based, which means less energy consumed from the grid. © 2020","Autonomous control; Deep reinforcement learning; Demand response; Residential home energy management","Automation; Deep learning; Demand side management; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy management systems; Energy utilization; Heating; Hot water distribution systems; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Learning systems; Renewable energy resources; Water; Autonomous control; Deep reinforcement learning; Demand response; Domestic hot water; Home energy managements; Optimisations; Reduce energy consumption; Reinforcement learnings; Residential home energy management; Residential homes; Reinforcement learning","P.

Optimization process included the classical parameters that previous studies recommended such as operating pressure, and feed and draw fractions in the mixture solution. The study has revealed that the recommended operating pressure ΔP=Δπ/2 and the ratio of feed or draw solution to the total mixture solution, ̴ 0.5, in a laboratory scale unit or in an ideal PRO process are not valid in a non-ideal full-scale PRO module. The optimization suggested that the optimum operating pressure is less than the previously recommended value of ΔP=Δπ/2. The optimization of hydraulic pressure resulted in 4.4% increase of the energy output in the PRO process. Conversely, optimization of feed fraction in the mixture has resulted in 28%–70% higher energy yield in a single-module PRO process and 9%–54% higher energy yield in a four-modules PRO process.

By intelligently considering uncertainties on the schedule development, renewable energy systems with storage could improve dispatching accuracy, and therefore, effectively participate in electricity wholesale markets. Deterministic forecasts have been traditionally used to support dispatch planning, representing reduced or no uncertainty information about the future weather. Aiming at better representing the uncertainties involved, probabilistic forecasts have been developed to increase forecasting accuracy. For the dispatch planning, this can highly influence the development of a more precise schedule. This work extends a dispatch planning method to the use of probabilistic weather forecasts. The underlying method used a schedule optimizer coupled to a post-processing machine learning algorithm. This machine learning algorithm was adapted to include probabilistic forecasts, considering their additional information on uncertainties. This post-processing applied a calibration of the planned schedule considering the knowledge about uncertainties obtained from similar past situations. Simulations performed with a concentrated solar power plant model following the proposed strategy demonstrated promising financial improvement and relevant potential in dealing with uncertainties. Results especially show that information included in probabilistic forecasts can increase financial revenues up to 15% (in comparison to a persistence solar driven approach) if processed in a suitable way. © 2020 by the authors.","Dispatch; Machine learning; Optimization; Probabilistic forecasts; Renewable systems; Storage","Commerce; Energy storage; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Concentrated solar power; Deterministic forecasts; Dispatch; Financial improvement; Forecasting accuracy; Probabilistic forecasts; Renewable energy systems; Uncertainty informations; Weather forecasting","A.C.

Power Quality (PQ) standards define load characteristics in electric power systems and their ability to function properly without failures. Monitoring, prediction and optimization of PQ parameters are necessary to maintain their alterations steady within the prescribed range, which allow fault-tolerant operation of various electrical devices. It is not possible to measure complete PQ data for all possible combinations of dozens of grid-connected appliances, whose load specifics and collisions primarily determine the course of PQ parameters and their eventual disturbances. Self-adapting PQ prediction models based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are required as induced power is influenced particularly by changeable weather conditions in real off-grid operation mode of systems using RE. A novel multi-step PQ prediction algorithm is proposed, which develops AI models with the gradually increasing number of selected input PQ-parameters. In each next step a more complex model is formed, using an additional co-related PQ-input to calculate its target PQ-output with a better accuracy. PQ-models with the progressively growing PQ-inputs, using their data predicted in the previous step, can better approximate and estimate the target quantity.

The dispatch problem for direct current tie-line in inter-regional power grid with uncertain renewable sources and demands was researched in this paper. Firstly, the random dynamic characteristics of wind power output and load demand was described as continuous Markov process. Secondly, based on practical operation requirements including the power balance constraint and the limit of tie-line power, the optimal dispatch problem for direct current tie-line was described as a discrete Markov decision process. According to the power of renewable energy output and load demand, the optimized strategy for the plan of tie-line and flexible load in each period was established to promote the running benefit of the system in this model. Finally, a reinforcement learning method was adopted to obtain the optimal policy. The daily average cost of system operation decreases significantly and eventually converges by reinforcement learning.

To extract the most out of a renewable system and to go greener, new approaches are evolving. In this paper, the capability of Artificial Neural Network and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System in geometrical optimization of a solar chimney power plant (SCPP) to enhance generated power is investigated to reduce the time cost and errors when optimization is performed with numerical or experimental methods. It is seen that both properly constructed artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive network- based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) optimized geometries give higher performance than the numerical results. Also, to validate the accuracy of the ANN and ANFIS predictions, the obtained results are compared with the numerical results. Both soft computing methods over predict the power output values with MRE values of 12.36% and 7.25% for ANN and ANFIS, respectively. It is seen that by utilizing ANN and ANFIS algorithms, more power can be extracted from the SCPP system compared to conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) optimized geometry with trying a lot more geometries in a notably less time when it is compared with the numerical technique. It is worth mentioning that the optimization method that is developed can be implemented to all engineering problems that need geometric optimization to maximize or minimize the objective function.

Few existing data in the literature indicate low maximum Cp, around 0.1. This study pursues demonstration of competitive radial wind turbines (RWT) towards exploring their potentials and increase the alternatives for a future urban energy planner. RWT may have advantages in adapting the renewable energy concept into buildings due to their an order-of-magnitude lower rotational speeds compared to propeller turbines, enclosed rotors and discharge of air uniquely from the top of the turbine (therefore the building). Moreover, such features may enable low-noise and fatigue-free rotors made of less durable but recyclable materials, crucial for acoustical comfort, safety and sustainability in urban areas. Design exploration over the complex 3D flowfield of the turbine is pursued by machine learning algorithms coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations. With the achieved peak Cp of 0.29 at Rec = 1.7 × 105, 103% improvement is attained relative to the existing RWTs with identical simulation methodologies. A sensitivity analysis revealed the most important parameters. The optimized turbine is compared with traditional alternatives, and it was elucidated that RWT is a competitive alternative among conventional alternatives with the described additional fundamental advantages. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CFD; Design optimization; Energy in buildings; Machine learning; Radial inflow wind turbine; Wind turbine","Computational fluid dynamics; Energy harvesting; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Sensitivity analysis; Wind power; Acoustical comfort; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Design Exploration; Propeller turbines; Radial (inflow) turbines; Recyclable material; Renewable energies; Simulation methodology; energy efficiency; machine learning; optimization; urban area; wind power; wind turbine; Wind turbines","S.
