   abstract = {To keep improving the efficiency-to-cost ratio of photovoltaic solar cells, manufacturing lines must be continuously improved. Efficiency optimization is usually performed process-wise and can be slow and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a machine-learning-based method to perform simultaneous multiprocess optimization. Using the natural variation of a production line, we train machine learning models to investigate the relationship between process parameters and cell efficiency. We employ genetic algorithms to identify new process parameters in order to maximize cell efficiency. The proposed method is demonstrated on a simulated production line of monocrystalline aluminum-back surface field solar cells. Using neural networks, an accurate model is built to predict cell efficiencies from input process parameters with errors of <0.03% absolute efficiency. In five iterations, the mean cell efficiency increases from 18.07% to 19.45%. Provided strong process monitoring and accurate wafer tracking, the proposed method is directly applicable to production-type datasets, enabling the photovoltaic industry to build smart factories and join the fourth industrial revolution.},

The current record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CZTSSe TFSCs is approximate to 13%, and it's still lower than CdTe and CIGS-based TFSCs. A further breakthrough in its PCE mainly relies on deep insights into the various device fabrication conditions; accordingly, the experimental-oriented machine learning (ML) approach can be an effective way to discover key governing factors in improving PCE. The present work aims to identify the key governing factors throughout the device fabrication processes and apply them to break the saturated PCE for CZTSSe TFSCs. For realization, over 25,000 data points were broadly collected by fabricating more than 1300 CZTSSe TFSC devices and analyzed them using various ML techniques. Through extensive ML analysis, the i-ZnO thickness is found to be the first, while Zn/Sn compositional ratio and sulfo-selenization temperature are other key governing factors under thin or thick i-ZnO thickness to achieve over 11% PCE. Based on these key governing factors, the applied random forest ML prediction model for PCE showed Adj. R-2 = >0.96. Finally, the best-predicted ML conditions considered for experimental validation showed well-matched experimental outcomes with different ML models.},

Pyrolysis has been widely used to convert PW into high-value-added products, especially liquid fuels, in a sustainable manner. However, achieving a high yield of liquid fuel with good quality remains challenging due to the difficulty in optimizing pyrolysis process and synthesizing outstanding catalysts to narrow the product distribution. This work comprehensively reviewed PW pyrolysis from both technical and computational (machine learning modeling) aspects, with a critical discussion of recent challenges to find new insights for improving the conversion efficiency and promoting commercialization. Results indicated that the impacts of various factors, including PW type, process condition, catalyst, and reactor type, on the PW pyrolysis were extensively investigated by the research community. Machine learning methods have also been frequently applied to predict, interpret, and optimize the PW pyrolysis. However, more efforts can be made in the future regarding catalyst synthesis, selection of co-pyrolysis additives, mechanism of catalyst deactivation, and design of renewable energy supply system for PW pyrolysis plants. Additionally, more attention should be paid to enlarging the data size, improving model interpretability, and exploring innovative ways of machine learning application (e.g., active learning) in process optimization and catalyst design for PW pyrolysis.},

Numbers of process design employing novel solvents and producing uncommon chemical, therefore, have been suffered from unknown physicochemical properties and resulting process models inherently has high degree of uncertainty. In this work, we developed and assessed a machine learning methodology to estimate parameter uncertainties, specify solvent physicochemical properties, and evaluate the reaction kinetics of a water-lean amine solvent for a CO2 capture process. We integrated two fundamental methodologies to decrease the experimental and computational costs. Gaussian process Bayesian optimization was applied to the pilot-scale tests; in addition, a rigorous process model employing a newly proposed hybrid Bayesian inference was used, which reduces the computational time of sampling. The assessment highlights the Gibbs free energy of the particular electrolyte as the most sensitive parameter to match the process responses. Both water and water lean amine solvent, K(2)Sol, were observed to act as dominant bases in the absorption kinetics. Furthermore, most output responses of the process model were located in the 95% confidence interval. Our methodology efficiently incorporates process optimization from past experiments and simultaneously identifies solvent characteristics to build rigorous process models that automatically consider uncertainties.},

Several input parameters were considered for the model including reaction temperature, reaction time, catalyst loading, methanol/oil molar ratio, whereas the percent of biodiesel production yield was the only output. Three ensemble models were utilized in this study: Boosted Linear Regression, Boosted Multi-layer Perceptron, and Forest of Randomized Tree for optimization of the yield. We then found their optimized configurations for each model, namely hyper-parameters. This critical task is done by running more than 1000 combinations of hyper-parameters. Finally, The R-2-Scores for Boosted Linear Regression, Boosted Multi-layer Perceptron, and Forest of Randomized Tree, respectively, were 0.926, 0.998, and 0.992. MAPE criterion revealed that the error rates for boosted linear regression, boosted multi-layer perceptron, and Forest of Randomized Tree was 5.68 x 10(-2), 5.20 x 10(-2), and 9.83 x 10(-2), respectively. Furthermore, utilizing the input vector (X1 = 165, X2 = 5.72, X3 = 5.55, X4 = 13.0), the proposed technique produces an ideal output value of 96.7 % as the optimum yield in catalytic production of biodiesel from waste cooking oil.

The purposes of this study were to investigate the ML-based prediction of bio-crude yield (BCY) and their higher heating values (HHVs) from HTL of lignocellulosic biomass and to elucidate the relationship of features affecting the output of interest. Pre-processing and normalization were applied to a dataset of 215 data points with 17 input features. Feature selection using the Shapley value method identified key predictors. ML models including multilayer perceptron, kernel ridge regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were trained and evaluated. XGB algorithm shows superior performance in predicting the yields and their calorific values to within 5-8% of experimental values. Temperature was the most influential feature for both BCY and HHV prediction accounting for about 30%, followed by other feedstock and operational characteristics.

However, the presence of tar in syngas poses a significant challenge to biomass gasification due to the difficulties in its removal and potential downstream issues, such as clogging, slagging, and corrosion. Extensive efforts have been made to address this challenge through catalytic tar removal using various catalysts, generating a vast amount of experimental data. Processing this large dataset and gaining new insights into process optimization requires the development of efficient data analysis methods. In this study, a comprehensive database was built, encompassing a total of 584 data points and 14 input parameters collected from literature published between 2005 and 2020. Machine learning algorithms were then trained using this dataset to predict and optimize the catalytic steam reforming of biomass tar. The predicted results were found to agree well with the experimental data. The results show that the reaction temperature is the most important process parameter, with the highest relative importance of 0.24, followed by the support (0.16), additive (0.12), nickel (Ni) loading (0.08), and calcination temperature (0.07), among the 14 input parameters. This work has proposed optimal ranges for the reaction temperature (600-700 degrees C), Ni loading (5-15 wt%), and calcination temperature (500-650 degrees C). Furthermore, it was found that a larger specific surface area and higher Ni dispersion are two critical factors for selecting additives and supports.

An advanced model based on artificial neural networks has been developed to predict solar photovoltaic panel plant metrics. This model integrates a state-of-the-art non-linear programming framework using Pyomo as well as an innovative optimization and machine learning toolkit library. This approach creates surrogate models for individual photovoltaic plants including production timelines. While this research, conducted through extensive simulations and meticulous computations, unveiled that Latin America has been significantly underrepresented in the production of silicon, wafers, cells, and modules within the global market; it also demonstrates the substantial potential of scaling up photovoltaic panel production in Mexico, leading to significant economic, social, and environmental benefits. By hyperparameter optimization, an outstanding and competitive artificial neural network model has been developed with a coefficient of determination values above 0.99 for all output variables. It has been found that water and energy consumption during PV panel production is remarkable. However, water consumption (33.16 × 10−4 m3/kWh) and the emissions generated (1.12 × 10−6 TonCO2/kWh) during energy production are significantly lower than those of conventional power plants. Notably, the results highlight a positive economic trend, with module production plants generating the highest profits (35.7%) among all production stages, while polycrystalline silicon production plants yield comparatively lower earnings (13.0%). Furthermore, this study underscores a critical factor in the photovoltaic panel production process which is that cell production plants contribute the most to energy consumption (39.7%) due to their intricate multi-stage processes. The blending of Machine Learning and optimization models heralds a new era in resource allocation for a more sustainable renewable energy sector, offering a brighter, greener future.},

   abstract = {Biorefinery processes for converting lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals proceed via an integrated series of steps. Biomass is first pretreated and deconstructed using chemical catalysts and/or enzymes to liberate sugar monomers and lignin fragments. Deconstruction is followed by a conversion step in which engineered host organisms assimilate the released sugar monomers and lignin fragments, and produce value-added fuels and chemicals. Over the past couple of decades, a significant amount of work has been done to develop innovative biomass deconstruction and conversion processes that efficiently solubilize biomass, separate lignin from the biomass, maximize yields of bioavailable sugars and lignin fragments and convert the majority of these carbon sources into fuels, commodity chemicals, and materials. Herein, we advocate that advanced in silico approaches provide a theoretical framework for developing efficient processes for lignocellulosic biomass valorization and maximizing yields of sugars and lignin fragments during deconstruction and fuel and chemical titers during conversion. This manuscript surveys the latest developments in lignocellulosic biomass valorization with special attention given to highlighting computational approaches used in process optimization for lignocellulose pretreatment; enzyme engineering for enhanced saccharification and delignification; and prediction of the genome modification necessary for desired pathway fine-tuning to upgrade products from biomass deconstruction into value-added products. Physics-based modeling approaches such as density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations have been most impactful in studies aimed at exploring the molecular level details of solvent-biomass interactions, reaction mechanisms occurring in biomass-solvent systems, and the catalytic mechanisms and engineering of enzymes involved in biomass degradation. More recently, with ever increasing amounts of data from, for example, advanced mutli-omics experiments, machine learning approaches have begun to make important contributions in synthetic biology and optimization of metabolic pathways for production of biofuels and chemicals.},

   abstract = {Catalytic co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic wastes is an efficient way for monoaromatic-rich oil production, while it is difficult to conclude oil evolution rule due to the complex interaction of multiple factors during copyrolysis. Hence, multiple machine learning algorithms were devised to aid process optimization and zeolite catalyst screening. The results showed that gradient boosting decision tree model performed the best prediction accuracy and generalization ability, as its coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error were 0.90 and 5.04, compared to random forest (R2 - 0.84), extreme gradient boosting (R2 - 0.90), and light gradient boosting machine (R2 - 0.86). Both feature importance and partial dependence analysis showed that operating parameters, catalyst properties, and feedstock composition were in the descending order to affect oil yield with monoaromatic selectivity. The reaction temperature (-500 degrees C) and feedstock/catalyst ratio (<5:1) had preferable influence on higher oil yield. The optimal selectivity of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEXs) in oil would be obtained at plastic proportion of around 60 wt% and Si/Al ratio of 20-30. The two-way PDA about interaction effect between multiple factors for oil products were also discussed in detail. The work favors to rationalize large-scale oil production from pyrolysis of solid wastes.},

Herein, we present a machine learning (ML)-guided framework of sequential learning for manufacturing the process optimization of perovskite solar cells. We apply our methodology to the rapid spray plasma processing (RSPP) technique for open-air perovskite device fabrication. With a limited experimental budget of screening 100 process conditions, we demonstrated an efficiency improvement to 18.5% as the best result from a device fabricated by RSPP. Our model is enabled by three innovations: flexible knowledge transfer between experimental processes by incorporating data from prior experimental data as a probabilistic constraint, incorporation of both subjective human observations and ML insights when selecting next experiments, and adaptive strategy of locating the region of interest using Bayesian optimization before conducting local exploration for high-efficiency devices. Furthermore, in virtual benchmarking, our framework achieves faster improvements with limited experimental budgets than traditional design-of-experiments methods.},

Tool life is modeled using a classification method since the exact tool life cannot be measured in a typical production environment where tool wear can only be directly measured when the tool is replaced. In this study, laboratory tool wear experiments are used to simulate tool wear data normally collected during part production. Two states are defined: tool not worn (class 0) and tool worn (class 1). The non-linear reduction in tool life with cutting speed is modeled by applying a logarithmic transformation to the inputs for the logistic classification model. A method for interpretability of the logistic model coefficients is provided by comparison with the empirical Taylor tool life model. The method is validated using tool wear experiments for milling. Results show that the physics-guided logistic classification method can predict tool life using limited datasets. A method for pre-process optimization of machining parameters using a probabilistic machining cost model is presented. The proposed method offers a robust and practical approach to tool life modeling and process parameter optimization in a production environment.},

   abstract = {Ultrasonic metal welding (UMW) is a solid-state joining technique with varied industrial applications. Despite of its numerous advantages, UMW has a relative narrow operating window and is sensitive to variations in process conditions. As such, it is imperative to quantitatively characterize the influence of welding parameters on the resulting joint quality. The quantification model can be subsequently used to optimize the parameters. Conventional response surface methodology (RSM) usually employs linear or polynomial models, which may not be able to capture the intricate, nonlinear input-output relationships in UMW. Furthermore, some UMW applications call for simultaneous optimization of multiple quality indices such as peel strength, shear strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. To address these challenges, this paper develops a machine learning (ML) based RSM to model the input-output relationships in UMW and jointly optimize two quality indices, namely, peel and shear strengths. The performance of various ML methods including spline regression, Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector regression (SVR), and conventional polynomial regression models with different orders is compared. A case study using experimental data shows that GPR with radial basis function (RBF) kernel and SVR with RBF kernel achieve the best prediction accuracy. The obtained response surface models are then used to optimize a compound joint strength indicator that is defined as the average of normalized shear and peel strengths. In addition, the case study reveals different patterns in the response surfaces of shear and peel strengths, which has not been systematically studied in the literature. While developed for the UMW application, the method can be extended to other manufacturing processes.},

   abstract = {In Machine Learning, the most common way to address a given problem is to optimize an error measure by training a single model to solve the desired task. However, sometimes it is possible to exploit latent information from other related tasks to improve the performance of the main one, resulting in a learning paradigm known as Multi-Task Learning (MTL). In this context, the high computational capacity of deep neural networks (DNN) can be combined with the improved generalization performance of MTL, by designing independent output layers for every task and including a shared representation for them. In this paper we exploit this theoretical framework on a problem related to Wind Power Ramps Events (WPREs) prediction in wind farms. Wind energy is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, with potential global spreading and deep penetration in developed and developing countries. One of the main issues with the majority of renewable energy resources is their intrinsic intermittency, which makes it difficult to increase the penetration of these technologies into the energetic mix. In this case, we focus on the specific problem of WPREs prediction, which deeply affect the wind speed and power prediction, and they are also related to different turbines damages. Specifically, we exploit the fact that WPREs are spatially-related events, in such a way that predicting the occurrence of WPREs in different wind farms can be taken as related tasks, even when the wind farms are far away from each other. We propose a DNN-MTL architecture, receiving inputs from all the wind farms at the same time to predict WPREs simultaneously in each of the farms locations. The architecture includes some shared layers to learn a common representation for the information from all the wind farms, and it also includes some specification layers, which refine the representation to match the specific characteristics of each location. Finally we modified the Adam optimization algorithm for dealing with imbalanced data, adding costs which are updated dynamically depending on the worst classified class. We compare the proposal against a baseline approach based on building three different independent models (one for each wind farm considered), and against a state-of-the-art reservoir computing approach. The DNN-MTL proposal achieves very good performance in WPREs prediction, obtaining a good balance for all the classes included in the problem (negative ramp, no ramp and positive ramp).},

Excessive demand of energy, depleting the fossil fuel reserves of planet and releasing the toxic air pollutant, has been causing harm to earth habitats. In this new situation, insufficiency of energy supplies, rising power generating costs, high capital cost of renewable energy equipment, environmental concerns of wind power turbines, and ever-increasing demand for electrical energy need efficient economic dispatch. The objective function in practical economic dispatch (ED) problem is nonlinear and non-convex, with restricted equality and inequality constraints, and traditional optimization methods are incapable of resolving such non-convex problems. Over the recent decade, meta-heuristic optimization approaches have acquired enormous reputation for obtaining a solution strategy for such types of ED issues. In this paper, a novel soft computing optimization technique is proposed for solving the dynamic economic dispatch problem (DEDP) of complex non-convex machines with several constraints. Our premeditated framework employs the genetic algorithm (GA) as an initial optimizer and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) for the fine tuning of the pre-optimized run of GA. The simulation analysis of GA-SQP performs well by acquiring less computational cost and finite time of execution, while providing optimal generation of powers according to the targeted power demand and load, whereas subject to valve point loading effect (VPLE) and multiple fueling option (MFO) constraints. The adequacy of the presented strategy concerning accuracy, convergence as well as reliability is verified by employing it on ten benchmark case studies, including non-convex IEEE bus system at the same time also considering VPLE of thermal power plants. The potency of designed optimization seems more robust with fast convergence rate while evaluating the hard bounded DEDP. Our suggested hybrid method GA-SQP converges to achieve the best optimal solution in a confined environment in a limited number of simulations. The simulation results demonstrate applicability and adequacy of the given hybrid schemes over conventional methods.},

   abstract = {In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the incorporation of data-driven machine learning techniques into process optimization. Such integration improves the computational time required for calculations during optimization and benefits the online application of advanced control algorithms. The proposed method is illustrated via the chemical absorption-based postcombustion CO2 capture process, which plays an important role in the reduction of CO2 emissions to address climate challenges. These processes simulated in a software environment are typically based on first-principle models and calculate physical properties from basic physical quantities such as mass and temperature. Employing first-principle models usually requires a long computation time, making process optimization and control challenging. To overcome this challenge, in this study, machine learning algorithms are used to simulate the postcombustion CO2 capture process. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms are employed to build models for prediction of carbon capture rate (CR) and specific reboiler duty (SRD). The R-2 (a statistical measure that represents the fitness) of these models is, on average, greater than 90% for all the cases. XGBoost and SVR take 0.022 and 0.317 s, respectively, to predict CR and SRD of 1318 cases, whereas the first-principal process simulation model needs 3.15 s to calculate one case. The models built by XGBoost are employed in the optimization methods, such as an agent-based approach represented by the particle swarm optimization and stochastic technique indicated by the simulated annealing, to find specific optimal operating conditions. The most economical case, in which the CR is 72.2% and SRD is 4.3 MJ/kg, is obtained during optimization. The results show that computations with the data-driven models incorporated in the optimization technique are faster than first-principle modeling approaches. Thus, the application of machine learning techniques in the optimization of carbon capture technologies is demonstrated successfully.},

Additionally, the review examines the application of aid-in investigation tools such as kinetics, machine learning, and feasibility analysis to HTL research. All these aspects have been underexplored in review literature compared to process optimization, biocrude upgrading, continuous HTL, and aqueous phase reutilization. The potential of HTL as an effective method for the depolymerization of plastics is initially evaluated. The ease of plastic depolymerization follows the order of polycarbonate (300 degrees C) > polystyrene (350 degrees C) > polyethylene = polypropylene (420 degrees C) > polyethylene terephthalate (>450 degrees C). Both synergism and antagonism are observed for co-HTL of plastics with biomass, ranging from-48.3% to 79.2%. Using seawater as an alternative HTL processing medium shows promising potential, while the effect of sea salts on biocrude yield/ quality is still controversial especially when carbohydrate-rich feedstocks are utilized, necessitating more comprehensive examination. Microwave irradiation has been shown to increase biocrude yield from lipid, produce comparable yields from protein and lignin, and decrease yield from carbohydrate compared to conventional heating. As for the aid-in investigation tools, limited efforts have been made to apply kinetic modeling to the HTL of plastics, which could be particularly useful when synergism or antagonism is observed during coHTL of plastics and biomass. Machine learning-enabled predictions of product yield and quality have been found to be more accurate than traditional mathematical models. Future research could focus on using machine learning algorithms to elucidate product formation mechanisms. The techno-economic and life cycle assessment reveal that the commercialization of HTL technology remains a distant prospect, further improvements in product yield, quality, and process energy efficiency are essential. Overall, this review offers augmented insights into HTL technology and facilitates the identification of novel opportunities, which is of value to promote the biocrude production.},

With the rapid economic development, the global greenhouse effect caused by excessive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is also accumulating, which generates the negative impact of global warming on nature and human beings. Meanwhile, economy and CO2 emissions prediction methods based on traditional neural networks lead to gradient disappearance or gradient explosion, making the economy and CO2 emissions prediction inaccurate. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel economy and CO2 emissions prediction model based on a residual neural network (RESNET) to optimize and analyze energy structures of different countries or regions in the world. The skip links are used in the inner residual block of the RESNET to alleviate vanishing gradients due to increasing depth in deep neural networks. Consequently, the proposed RESNET can optimize this problem and protect the integrity of information by directly bypassing the input information to the output, which can increase the precision of the prediction model. The needs for natural gas, hydroelectricity, oil, coal, nuclear energy, and renewable energy in 24 different countries or regions from 2009 to 2020 are used as inputs, the CO2 emissions and the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita are respectively used as the undesired output and the desired output of the RESNET to build an economy and CO2 emissions prediction model. The experimental results show that the RESNET has higher correctness and functionality than the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN), the radial basis function (RBF), the extreme learning machine (ELM) and the back propagation (BP). Furthermore, the proposed model provides guidance and development plans for countries or regions with low energy efficiency, which can improve energy efficiency, economic development and reasonably control CO2 emissions.},

   abstract = {The circular economy of rare earth metals (REM), such as dysprosium, is essential for a sustain-able future in clean energy and high-tech fields. Adsorption has gained attention to recover and reintegrate REM into the productive chain; however, accurate modeling of adsorptive processes still needs to be addressed, which delays further scale-up studies. Thus, this paper studied the ad-sorption of Dy on expanded vermiculite and applied novel empirical methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and the classical re-sponse surface methodology (RSM) for modeling of dysprosium recovery as a function of adsor-bent size, mass, and pH of the solution, variables often ignored in the mathematical modeling of adsorption. In our work, the effect of each operational parameter on Dy removal efficiency was examined by the RSM approach, in which only the adsorbent dosage and pH were the significant factors. So, ANFIS with two input membership functions (Gaussian type) was the most accurate procedure to predict and model the dysprosium removal efficiency (R2 = 0.99681). Also, vermi-culite removed dysprosium with high efficiency (99.2%) under the best experimental conditions, at pH around 3.5 and adsorbent mass of 0.64 g, indicating an effective process optimization. The loaded vermiculite, after the adsorption, was characterized by textural and thermal properties that confirmed the stability of the material. Thus, according to basic operational parameters, ac-curate modeling of the Dy adsorption on expanded vermiculite (a low-cost, available, and non-toxic material) can improve adsorption technology's maturity to reconcentrate and recover rare earth metals.},

   abstract = {Forecasting of wastewater treatment plant inflow dynamics constitutes an enabler technology for wastewater treatment process optimization using model predictive control. However, accurate inflow prediction is still challenging, especially for strong rainfall events, where complex system dynamics and missing information on future rainfall represent limiting factors. We propose a seasonal probabilistic time series model for modeling the short-term wastewater inflow accurately while providing quantification of forecast uncertainty. To ensure suitability for practical implementation, the unconstrained parameters of the predictive distribution are modeled as linear functions of the input variables in the framework of Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape. Non-linear effects are approximated by Rectified Linear Units, accounting for buffering within the sewer network and flow-dependent catchment response time. In addition to water level measurements from within the sewer network and rain rate measurements, rain forecasts are incorporated as exogenous regressors, where historical rain forecasts are used for model calibration. The model performance is evaluated on historical data from a German wastewater treatment plant using deterministic and probabilistic scoring rules. We benchmark against an autoregressive time series model and a long short-term memory artificial neural network. Our results show that the proposed model unites the benefits of high prediction accuracy of the neural network and enhanced intelligibility of the autoregressive model, but accurate real-time rain forecasts are mandatory for successful real-world implementation.
   The wastewater treatment process accounts for a large proportion of a wastewater treatment plant's energy consumption. Here, an accurate prediction of future wastewater inflow is an important tool for the optimization of energy efficiency. The potential for optimization is particularly large for rain events. However, especially in such situations, inflow prediction is most challenging. We developed a specialized computer algorithm for inflow prediction that utilizes weather forecasts in order to produce reliable inflow predictions in such situations. The developed algorithm is a machine learning model that learns the knowledge needed to perform accurate predictions from historical data. Although capable machine learning models are generally complex, we aimed to design the algorithm in such a way that it is understandable and hence trustworthy for practitioners so that it can easily be used in real-world application. We tested the algorithm and our results show that it is possible to generate precise wastewater inflow predictions, but very accurate and quickly available weather forecasts are mandatory, which is an interesting objective for further research.
   We propose a model for probabilistic wastewater treatment plant inflow prediction utilizing rain forecast data to handle rain eventsNon-linear dynamics within the sewer system are approximated in a linear framework using rectified linear unitsOur results indicate similar performance to less intelligible non-linear models, but rain forecast accuracy constitutes a limitation},
